.\" {{{ DESCRIPTION
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
B<update-eix> generates a binary cache from your local portage-tree and overlays.
B<eix> searches this cache for packages that match the criteria you specified.
B<diff-eix> compares two binary caches and finds packages that were added, removed or for
which the highest stable versions has changed.
B<eix-sync> removes the old dep-cache (see B<HISTORY>), runs B<emerge --sync> (or B<emerge --metadata>) and B<update-eix>, it then
compares the new cache with the old cache using B<diff-eix>, while redirecting all output
from B<emerge> and B<update-eix> to I</var/log/eix-sync.log> for cleanliness.

.\" {{{ -------- Common options
.SS Common options
These options are common to all programs in the eix-suite.
.TP
.BR -q ", " --quiet
Produce no output on stderr and stdout (fatal errors which occur at the
beginning of execution are printed to stderr, regardless of this option).
.TP
.BR --dump
Show the current eixrc-variables and their defaults.

Disables the use of ANSI color codes. This is useful for terminals that do not support ANSI colors.
(This is automatically turned on if stdout is no tty, but can be overridden by using --force-color)
.TP
.BR -F ", " --force-color
The opposite of --nocolor.
.TP
.BR -t ", " --test-non-matching
Before other output, print entries of /etc/portage/package.* which do not
match any existing version in the package database.
This option is best combined with -T to clean up /etc/portage/package.*.

Causes eix to use a compact layout for search results. Useful for obtaining a better
overview in the case of a long list of results, and also to help speed up searching over
slow connections such as a serial console.
.TP
.BR -v ", " --verbose
Use a verbose layout with additional information about search results such as the license
of a package.

Only match installed packages. Please don't use this as a replacement for qlist -ICv or
equery, it's not the same. This only show packages that could be installed and that are
installed. Packages that are installed, but no longer in portage are not listed here.
.TP
.BR -d ", " --dup-packages
Only match duplicated packages,
for example, if sys-foo/bar exists both in the official portage tree and a local overlay.
If B<DUP_PACKAGES_ONLY_OVERLAYS> is set (see below), the instances must be in two different local overlays.
.TP

Only match packages with duplicated versions,
for example, if sys-foo/bar-0.2.1 exists both in the official portage tree and a local overlay.
If B<DUP_VERSIONS_ONLY_OVERLAYS> is set (see below), both instances must be in overlays.

.SH OUTPUT
If you used gentoo for more than a week you're probably going to immediately
recognize the format of the versions-strings. Nevertheless, we are going to
explain them here.
.TP
.BR [P]2.95.3-r8
If a mask for the package was found in the packages-files from your profile, but this
version does not match it, the version is determined to be "masked by profile".
.TP
.BR [M]4.0.0_alpha20050213
The version matches a mask from /etc/portage/package.mask, $PORTDIR/profiles/package.mask
or a package.mask from your profile. Portage calls this "masked by package.mask".
.TP
.BR *3.4.3-r2
That version is "masked by -* keyword".
.TP
.BR !3.3.3
This means the version is "masked by missing keyword".
.TP
.BR -0.8.14
Masked by -ARCH.
.TP
.BR ~3.3.5.20050130
The version would be "masked by ~keyword".
.TP
.BR 3.3.1
.RS
Finally, this would be a stable version.

.\" {{{ FORMATSTRING
.SH FORMATSTRING
.LP
A formatstring can contain conditional blocks, package properties, colors and
normal strings.

.\" {{{ -------- Conditional blocks
.SS Conditional blocks
Conditions are very simple: A property is expanded and the resulting string is
tested against another string. If they are the same, the condition is true and
the block is executed. Conditions can be negated so that the else-part is
executed if the conditions is true, and the if-part if the condition is false.
The else-part can be also be completely left out.
.TP
.BR { [ ! ] I<VARIABLE> [ = I<STRING>] } I<TCODE> {}
Execute I<TCODE> if the string resulting from expanding I<VARIABLE> is equal to
I<STRING>.
The B<!> would negate the behavior.

.TP
.BR { [ ! ] I<VARIABLE> [ = I<STRING>] } I<TCODE> {else} I<FCODE> {}
Execute I<TCODE> if the string resulting from expanding I<VARIABLE> is equal to
I<STRING>.  If it's not, execute I<FCODE>.

.SS Package properties
Names that refer to specific properties of the package that is currently
printed. If used to print a property, the name B<must be enclosed in square brackets>
(i.e. "<name>").
.TP
.BR name ", " category ", " homepage ", " licenses
The name, category, homepage and licenses for the current package.

.TP
.BR MARK_INSTALLED "  " (none ", " bold ", " underline ", " blink ", " inverse)
Mark the installed packages by this attribute when displaying versions.

.TP

Mark the package versions passed with B<--pipe> by this attribute.

.TP
.BR FORCE_USECOLORS "  " (true / false)
Use colors even when stdout is not a terminal.

.TP
.BR STYLE_VERSION_LINES "  " (true / false)
Turns --versionlines on.

.TP
.BR SMALL_EIX_DATABASE "  " (true / false)
Keep database small at the cost of never honoring keywords of other ARCH.
Only set this to true if you really must save disk space.

.TP
.BR DUP_PACKAGES_ONLY_OVERLAYS "  " (true / false)
Defines whether duplicate package checks occur only among overlays, i.e. a
package is only considered as duplicate if it occurs in at least two
different overlays.

.TP
.BR DUP_VERSIONS_ONLY_OVERLAYS "  " (true / false)
Defines whether duplicate version checks occur only among overlays, i.e. a
version is only considered as duplicate if it occurs at least twice in
overlays.

.TP
.BR DEFAULT_IS_OR "  " (true / false)
If several pattern arguments occur without logical concatenation (-a or -o),
eix assumes an implicit concatenation. If this variable is true, it assumes
that this concatenation is -o (or), otherwise -a (and).

.TP
.BR OVERLAYS_LIST "  " (all / all-if-used / all-used / all-used-renumbered / no)
People with many different overlays do not want to see all overlays listed at
the end but only those which are really used. Here, you can customize the
behaviour. The value is interpreted as follows:
.TP
.SS
.BR all-if-used / if-used / if
Display all overlays, if at least one is used. This was the default behaviour
before eix-0.6.0.
.TP
.SS
.BR used-renumbered / renumber / renumbered / number
Display only the overlays actually used, numbering them "correctly"
(i.e. if only two overlays are needed, number them [1] and [2]).
The disadvantage is that overlays get different numbers for different queries.
However, the order of the numbering is consistent.
.TP
.SS
.BR all-used / only-used / used
Display only the overlays actually used, keeping the numbering consistent
over all queries (on the same database).
.TP
.SS
.BR no / false
Never display a list of overlays.
.TP
.SS
.BR "" "anything else"
List all overlays for every query (even if not even one is needed).

.TP
.BR LEVENSHTEIN_DISTANCE "  " (Integer)
Set default levenshtein-distance.

.TP
.BR EXCLUDE_OVERLAY "  " (String)
Set a list of overlays that are excluded from the index (separators are [\\n\\r\\t ]).

.TP
.BR ADD_OVERLAY "  " (String)
Set a list of overlays that are added to the index (separators are [\\n\\r\\t ]).

.TP
.BR PORTDIR_CACHE_METHOD ", " OVERLAY_CACHE_METHOD "  " (Strings)
Set the type of the cache used by portage. If you don't know what this is, just leave it
alone.
B<PORTDIR_CACHE_METHOD> defaults to I<@PORTDIR_CACHE_METHOD@>, B<OVERLAY_CACHE_METHOD> to
I<none>.

.TP
.SS
.BR cdb
You are using the cdb-module from

.\" {{{ HISTORY
.SH "HISTORY"
.LP
B<eix> was formerly known as B<portagedb>. The name was changed because a part of
portage is also called portagedb, which was a bit confusing for everyone.

The functionality of update-eix was once triggered by using the -u switch on
eix. It was than separated to provide better maintainability. Thus update-eix
came to life.

The new portage-versions (>=2.1_pre1) doen't remove the old dep-cache, thus eix would
always find packages that are not in portage anymore. To circumvent this, eix-sync
deletes the old cache (rm -fr /var/cache/edb/dep/*).
