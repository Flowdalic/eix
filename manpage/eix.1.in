.\" {{{ DESCRIPTION
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
B<eix-update> generates a binary cache from your local portage-tree and overlays.
B<eix> searches this cache for packages that match the criteria you specified.
B<eix-diff> compares two binary caches and finds packages that were added, removed or for
which the highest stable versions has changed.

All of these programs and scripts read the configuration files described later.
B<eix-sync> has an additional separate configuration file.

B<eix-sync> can sync the portage/overlay trees and compare them with the old cache
using B<eix-diff>.
To get more help on B<eix-sync> call B<eix-sync -h> and see the documentation
of I<@SYSCONFDIR@/eix-sync.conf> below.
Note that the content of the latter can also be stored in the variable
B<EIX_SYNC_CONF>.

B<eix-test-obsolete> is a script which calls B<eix> several times to display
the output of B<eix -tTc> in a more organized manner or to check for packages
installed with/without repository information.
To get more help on B<eix-test-obsolete> call <eix-test-obsolete -h>.

B<eix-remote> can sync an eix database from an external server and
add/remove it to the current database.
Note that to keep such remote data across eix-update calls
you might want to set B<KEEP_VIRTUALS=true> in @SYSCONFDIR@/eixrc.
To get more help on B<eix-remote> call B<eix-remote -h>
and see the documentation of I<@SYSCONFDIR@/eix-remote.conf> below.

B<eix-layman> can add or remove local layman overlays to the current database.
You might want to use this if you do not source layman's make.conf in your local I</etc/make.conf>.
To get more help on B<eix-layman> call B<eix-layman -h>.
B<eix-layman> is also meant as an example script how to use B<eix-functions.sh>:

B<eix-functions.sh> are helper functions used by B<eix-sync>, B<eix-remote>, and B<eix-layman>.
You might want to use them for your own similar scripts.
Note that immediately after sourcing B<eix-functions.sh> you will probably
want to call B<read_functions> [I<ARGS>] to source baselayout's functions.sh
with the corresponding I<ARGS>.

B<versionsort> is a helper tool for scripts which cuts the version strings from its arguments
and outputs them sorted according to the portage rules of version sorting.
Details can be found near the end of the manpage.

.\" {{{ EXAMPLES
.SH "EXAMPLES"

The following examples are some useful but perhaps unusual applications of eix.
They are listed here to give you an idea what unexpected things you can do with eix.
Since the examples are meant to be copied from this manpage they are listed early.
To understand how they work, you should read the full manpage, of course.

.TP
.IB cmd " | eix '-|*' --format '<markedversions:NAMESLOT>'"

Assuming I<cmd> creates a list of the form B<category/name-version> or B<=category/name-version>,
the above prints the corresponding list B<category/name> or B<category/name:SLOT>
(depending on whether B<SLOT>s need to be distinguished).

.TP
.IB cmd " | eix '-|*' --format '<markedversions:NAMEASLOT>'"

Similar to the above, but print always B<category/name:SLOT> even if B<SLOT>
may be redundant. (Mnemonic: B<A>lways).

.TP
.B eix '-I*' --format '<installedversions:NAMEVERSION>'

Print out installed packages, using the format B<category/name-version>.
Of course, you could replace B<NAMEVERSION> also by B<NAMESLOT> or B<NAMEASLOT> to get another format.
The only purpose of the B<I> option in this context is to speed up the output slightly.

.TP
.B eix '-I*' --format '<installedversions:EQNAMEVERSION>'

Similarly to the above but in the format B<=category/name-version> which you
can pipe directly to portage.

.TP
.B eix '-I*' --format '<installedversions:DATESORT>' | sort | cut -f2-3

Print out installed packages (with slots if necessary), sorted by installation date.
If you want the output in another format, you have to modify B<DATESORT> correspondingly
(you can see the original definition in the output of B<eix --dump>).

This sorting trick works as follows: The B<DATESORT> variable outputs as
the first column the seconds since epoch (B<eix --print DATESORT> will show you
that this happens by the variable B<DATESORT_DATE> whose first entry is B<%s>),
and B<sort> thus gets the correct order by sorting alphabetically.
Finally the B<cut> command gets rid of this first column which was only needed for sorting.

In the above examples, things like B<NAMEVERSION> and B<DATESORT> are actually
just names of variables which are predefined in eix (with B<eix --dump> you see them).
You can as well define your own variables and use them.
To understand how this works, please read the manpage, especially the description of the B<FORMAT> string.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.\" {{{ -------- Common options
.SS Common options
These options are common to B<eix>, B<eix-diff>, and B<eix-update>.
.TP
.BR -h ", " --help
Print a help screen and exit.
.TP
.BR -Q ", " --quick "   (toggle)    (not for B<eix-update>)"
Do (not) read the slots of installed versions which cannot be guessed
(i.e. installed versions of packages with at least two different slots
for which the installed version is not in the database anymore).
Note that with this option, eix and eix-diff might report false positives
for up-/downgrade recommendations for these packages.
.TP
.BR --care "    (not for B<eix-update>)"
This deactivates --quick, and moreover, slots of installed version are
always read instead of relying on the guess of the slot.
This will in particular make sure that you get an up-/downgrade
recommendation if a slot name of an installed version changes.
Note that this will dramatically decrease the speed at the first call.
(If your filesystem has a reasonable cache, later calls are almost not
slower than without this option.)
.TP
.BR -q ", " --quiet "   (toggle)"
Produce no output on stdout.
For eix you can decrease execution time by combining this
(depending on your needs) with either B<--brief> or B<--brief2>
and by setting B<COUNT_ONLY_PRINTED=false>.
See also B<NOFOUND_STATUS> and B<MOREFOUND_STATUS>
.TP
.B --dump
Show the current eixrc-variables, and their defaults as comments.
.TP
.B --dump-defaults
Show the defaults of the eixrc-variables, and their current values as comments.
.TP
.BI "--print " VAR
Print the specified variable I<VAR> of eixrc or of portage settings,
completely expanded as it would be used internally by eix.
This is mainly intended for usage in scripts or for debugging purposes.
If you use it in scripts you might want to specify B<PRINT_APPEND> to
get trailing spaces (see description of B<PRINT_APPEND>).
.TP
.BI "--print-overlay-path " OVERLAY
Print the path of the first overlay matching I<OVERLAY>.
I<OVERLAY> may be an overlay label, an overlay path (mask) or a number.
.TP
.BI "--print-overlay-label " OVERLAY
Print the path of the first overlay matching I<OVERLAY>.
I<OVERLAY> may be an overlay label, an overlay path (mask) or a number.

Prints available versions in a (vertical) list.
Moreover, the IUSE data is printed for each version
(and not collected for the whole package).
.TP
.BR -c ", " --compact "   (toggle)"
Causes eix to use a compact layout for search results. Useful for obtaining a better
overview in the case of a long list of results, and also to help speed up searching over
slow connections such as a serial console.
.TP
.BR -v ", " --verbose "   (toggle)"
Use a verbose layout with additional information about search results such as the license
of a package.
.TP
.BR --xml "   (toggle)"
Output in XML format.
If you use this option from an external program you will probably want to
combine this with B<--care> and export some variables like B<LOCAL_PORTAGE_CONFIG>
to make sure that the preferred user output settings do not influence your output.
If this option is active, B<OVERLAYS_LIST=none> and B<--pure-packages> are
automatically active.
The output format can be slightly influenced by the B<XML_*> variables.
The XML format used is documented in human-readable form in the files eix-xml.html or eix-xml.txt
and in less human-readable form (namely as an xml-schema) in the file eix-xml.xsd
.TP
.BR -* ", " --pure-packages "   (toggle)"
(do not forget quoting if you use the short form from within a shell.)
Omit printing of additional information (overlay names, number of found packages) after the packages.
This might be useful for some shell scripts parsing the output
.TP
.BR --only-names "   (toggle)"
As "-*", but additionally print only the category and name of the packages found.
.TP
.BR -0 ", " --brief "   (toggle)"
Print at most one package then stop.
This option is typically faster when used with B<COUNT_ONLY_PRINTED=false>.
In the latter case, when you use fuzzy search, not necessarily the best match is output.
.TP
.BR --brief2 "   (toggle)"
As B<--brief>, but print up to two packages.

.BR -t ", " --test-non-matching
Before other output, print entries of /etc/portage/package.* which do not
match any existing version in the package database or which apparently have
no meaning because they are empty (see B<TEST_FOR_EMPTY>).

This option also lists all installed packages whose name is not in the database.

Note that this is essentially different from B<-T> (see below).
The latter only tests for packages B<in the database> whether redundant
entries in /etc/portage/package.* exist or whether the installed versions
are available, respectively.

This option is best combined with B<-T> to clean up /etc/portage/package.*

Or you can combine it with B<-e> to have no other output.

If you have a reason to exclude certain entries/packages from this test,
you can write those entries into a file /etc/portage/package.*.nonexistent
where *=keywords,mask,unmask,use,cflags,installed.
These files (and how to modify their filenames) are described later.
.TP
.BI "--cache-file " FILE
Use I<FILE> instead of B<@EIX_CACHEFILE@>.

.\" {{{ -------- Options for EXPRESSION
.SS Options for EXPRESSION
A EXPRESSION is used to narrow which packages eix prints.

An EXPRESSION can contain Boolean operators and tests according to the following grammar:

EXPRESSION ::= [ B<--not> | B<-!> ] BRACE_OR_TEST |
               EXPRESSION [ B<--and>| B<-a> ] EXPRESSION |
               EXPRESSION [ B<--or> | B<-o> ] EXPRESSION

BRACE_OR_TEST ::= B<--open>|B<-(> EXPRESSION B<--close>|B<-)> |
               TEST_WITH_OPTIONS

TEST_WITH_OPTIONS ::= [TEST_OPTIONS] [PATTERN]

Do not forget that B<!>, B<(>, B<)> have to be quoted in shells so that
eix actually receives these as parts of arguments!

The meaning of the logical operators should be obvious with perhaps some exceptions:

1. If neither B<--and>|B<-a> nor B<--or>|B<-o> is between two EXPRESSIONs, then one of
them is implicitly assumed; whether this is B<-a> or B<-o> depends on the setting
of the configuration variable B<DEFAULT_IS_OR>.

2. The operators B<-a> and B<-o> have equal precedence and are left-associative.
In particular, B<X -o Y -a Z> fails if B<Z> fails.

3. B<--not>|B<-!> negates only the result of the subsequent BRACE_OR_TEST.

4. Observe that TEST_OPTIONS can consist of several options.
All of these options are applied simultaneously, i.e. in a sense these options
are logically braced and combined with B<and> (independent of B<DEFAULT_IS_OR>
This is somehow ambiguous, since B<PATTERN> can be omitted.
This ambiguity is resolved by interpreting subsequent TEST_OPTIONS always as a
part of one TEST_WITH_OPTIONS.

5. The TEST_OPTIONS can specify things like the B<match algorithm> and also B<operation selection>.
All these specifications refer B<only> to the current TEST_WITH_OPTIONS, in particular, they are only active for the next B<PATTERN>.

Note that besides using this expression syntax a different way of implicit
(though slow) package selection on various other criteria is possible by
defining B<FORMATSTRING> (see below) using conditionals such that it outputs
an empty string for the undesired packages.

Here are the admissible TEST_OPTIONS:
.TP
.BR -I ", " --installed
Only match installed packages.
Please do not use this as a replacement for qlist -ICv or equery, it is not the same:
Packages that are installed, but no longer in the portage tree (or overlays) are not listed here.
However, you should better not have such packages at all
(better put these packages in overlays in case you need to reinstall them).
To find such packages, you can use B<eix -te> (or B<eix -tI> to get listed both)
but be aware that eix -t does not obey the usual B<FORMAT> rules for these packages.
So you better do not use this in scripts unless you know what you are doing.

If you really want to use this option as a substitute for equery in scripts,
you might want to combine it with some of

.B --format --only-names

.B --format '<installedversions:NAMEVERSION>' --pure-packages

.B --format '<installedversions:EQNAMEVERSION>' --pure-packages

.B --format '<installedversions:NAMESLOT>' --pure-packages

.B --format '<installedversions:NAMEASLOT>' --pure-packages

.B --format '<installedversions:DATESORT>' --pure-packages
.TP
.BR -i ", " --multi-installed
Only match packages which are installed in at least two different versions.
Usually, this means that these versions are slotted (at installation time).
.TP
.BR -d ", " --dup-packages
Only match duplicated packages,
for example, if sys-foo/bar exists both in the official portage tree and a local overlay.
If B<DUP_PACKAGES_ONLY_OVERLAYS> is set (see below), the instances must be in two different local overlays.
.TP
.BR -D ", " --dup-versions
Only match packages with duplicated versions,
for example, if sys-foo/bar-0.2.1 exists both in the official portage tree and a local overlay.
If B<DUP_VERSIONS_ONLY_OVERLAYS> is set (see below), both instances must be in overlays.
.TP
.BR -1 ", " --slotted
Only match packages with a nontrivial slot, i.e. where SLOT is nonempty and different from "0".
.TP
.BR -2 ", " --slots
Only match packages with at least two different slots.
In contrast to -1, a package is not shown here, if only one slot is available with e.g. slot-name "4.3".
.TP
.BR -u ", " --upgrade ", " --upgrade+ ",  " --upgrade-
Only match packages which have at least one slotted version installed which
is not the best version within that slot.
This means usually that you should either upgrade or downgrade that package.

However, the test takes also B<UPGRADE_TO_HIGHEST_SLOT> (see below) into account.

If you use B<--upgrade+> or B<--upgrade->, then the test acts as if B<LOCAL_PORTAGE_CONFIG> is B<true> or B<false>.
Otherwise, this decision is based upon B<UPGRADE_LOCAL_MODE>.

If you want to see only packages with downgrade recommendations, you might make
use of the B<FORMATSTRING> features described below.
.TP
.BR --stable ", " --testing ", " --non-masked ", " --system
Only match packages which have at least one version which is stable (and non-masked),
testing or stable (and non-masked), non-masked, or in system, respectively.
If several of these options are combined in one test, it is the same version
which must satisfy all.
.TP
.BR --stable+ ", " --testing+ ", " --non-masked+ ", " --system+
This is as the above ones just that the test acts as if B<LOCAL_PORTAGE_CONFIG=true>.
.TP
.BR --stable- ", " --testing- ", " --non-masked- ", " --system-
This is as the above ones just that the test acts as if B<LOCAL_PORTAGE_CONFIG=false>.
.TP
.BR --installed-unstable ", " --installed-testing ", " --installed-masked
Only match packages which have at least one version installed which has
at least one non-stable, testing, or masked version installed
(the test acts as if B<LOCAL_PORTAGE_CONFIG=false>).
If several of these options are combined in one test, it is the same version
which must satisfy all.
.TP
.BR --world
Only match @world packages.
This is analogous to "emerge @world", i.e. it includes not only packages in
the world file but also in world sets and the @system set.
If you do not want to have all included, choose the appropriate alternative
option.
.TP
.BR --world-file
This only matches packages from the world file or from the @system set.
.TP
.BR --world-set
This only matches packages from world_set or from the @system set.
.TP
.BR --selected
Only match @selected packages.
This is analogous to "emerge @selected", i.e. it includes not only packages in
the world file but also in world_sets (if you have @system contained in the
world_sets file, then the behaviour is of course identical to B<--world>).
If you do not want to have both included, choose the appropriate alternative option.
.TP
.BR --selected-file
This only matches packages from the world file.
.TP
.BR --selected-set
This only matches packages from world_set.
.TP
.BR --binary
Only match packages with a binary file (*.tbz2) in PKGDIR.
The version of the binary file must either match the version of an available version or of an installed version.
(However, note that if no version is available, the package cannot be found either).
Just the existence of the corresponding *.tbz2 file is checked:
Whether portage can actually use the file depends also on metadata within the *.tbz2 file (like USE settings) which is not considered by eix.
.TP
.BR -O ", " --overlay
Only match packages with at least one version in an overlay.
.TP
.BI "--in-overlay " overlay
Only match packages with at least one version in an overlay matching I<overlay>.

If this option is repeated, the additional I<overlay> arguments are joined
to the list of admissible overlays.

I<overlay> may be either a wildcard pattern or a number.
Note that if you use the default B<OVERLAYS_LIST=all-used-renumbered>
you do not see the correct overlay numbers; to get a list of the correct
overlay numbers you can e.g. call

B<OVERLAYS_LIST=all eix --not>

or in scripts better

B<OVERLAYS_LIST=all PRINT_COUNT_ALWAYS=never eix -!>

The special values B<0> or B<$PORTDIR> match the "main" tree (which in
this connection is considered as the 0'th overlay).

If I<overlay> is empty (or omitted if B<--in-overlay> is the last option)
it matches all overlays except for the "main" tree
(i.e. B<--in-overlay ''> is the same as B<-O>).
.TP
.BI "--only-in-overlay " overlay
Only match packages which have only versions in an overlay matching I<overlay>.

If this option is repeated, the additional I<overlay> arguments are joined
to the list of admissible overlays.

I<overlay> may be either a wildcard pattern or a number, as in B<--in-overlay>.
As particular, B<--only-in-overlay ''> matches all packages which are not in
the official portage tree but only in some overlay.
.TP
.BR -J ", " --installed-overlay
Only match packages which have been installed from some overlay.
To get a completely reliable result you should set
B<CHECK_INSTALLED_OVERLAYS> to true (which is not the default because
it dramatically slows down the test).
See B<CHECK_INSTALLED_OVERLAYS> for details.
.TP
.BI "--installed-from-overlay " overlay
This is analogous to B<--in-overlay> with the difference that only
packages are matched which have at least one version installed
from I<overlay>.
For instance, B<--installed-from-overlay 0> will only match those packages
which have at least one version which was installed from the regular
portage tree.
As for -J, you should set B<CHECK_INSTALLED_OVERLAYS> to true to get a
completely reliable result.
.TP
.B --installed-in-some-overlay
Only match packages with at least one installed version number which is
also in some overlay.
.TP
.BI "--installed-in-overlay " overlay
This is analogous to B<--in-overlay> with the difference that only
packages are matched which have at least one installed version in I<overlay>.
For instance, B<--installed-in-overlay 0> will only match those packages
which have at least one version which is also in the regular portage tree.
.TP
.B --restrict-fetch
Only match packages which have at least one version with RESTRICT=fetch.
If used with other PROPERTIES/RESTRICT tests, the version must satisfy all simultaneously.
.TP
.B --restrict-mirror
Only match packages which have at least one version with RESTRICT=mirror.
If used with other PROPERTIES/RESTRICT tests, the version must satisfy all simultaneously.
.TP
.B --restrict-primaryuri
Only match packages which have at least one version with RESTRICT=primaryuri.
If used with other PROPERTIES/RESTRICT tests, the version must satisfy all simultaneously.

.B --restrict-strip
Only match packages which have at least one version with RESTRICT=strip.
If used with other PROPERTIES/RESTRICT tests, the version must satisfy all simultaneously.
.TP
.B --restrict-test
Only match packages which have at least one version with RESTRICT=test.
If used with other PROPERTIES/RESTRICT tests, the version must satisfy all simultaneously.
.TP
.B --restrict-userpriv

If used with other PROPERTIES/RESTRICT tests, the version must satisfy all simultaneously.
.TP
.BR -T ", " --test-obsolete
Only match obsolete packages.

Packages are obsolete if they have redundant entries in /etc/portage/package.*
(if B<TEST_FOR_REDUNDANCY> is true) or if not all installed versions exist
(if B<TEST_FOR_NONEXISTENT> is true).

What is considered as redundant is defined by the B<REDUNDANT_IF>-variables below,
and what is considered as non-existent is defined by the B<NONEXISTENT_IF>-variables.
Note that the test for versions from obsolete overlays works only reliable if
you set B<CHECK_INSTALLED_OVERLAYS> to true (which is not the default because
it dramatically slows down the test).
See B<CHECK_INSTALLED_OVERLAYS> for details.

Note that this options only tests packages in the database - in particular, you
will not find entries for e.g. renamed or removed (from the portage tree) packages with this option.
Use B<-t> to find the latter.

Therefore, this option is best combined with -t to find also other types of obsolete entries.

If you have a reason to exclude certain packages from this test,
you can write those entries into a file /etc/portage/package.*.nowarn
where *=keywords,mask,unmask,use,cflags,installed.
These files (and how to modify their filenames) are described later.
.TP
.BR -| ", " --pipe
(Recall that a shell will not pass an unquoted B<|> sign, so quote properly).

Only match packages from standard input; usually you will want to use this in a pipe,
redirected e.g. from emerge -pv (similar to genlop -p).
Actually, any input data is honored which contains words (space or newline separated) in the format

I<category>B</>I<package>B<->I<version> or

I<category>B</>I<package>

In addition, all packages/versions passed this way will in the output be considered marked.
For details on the latter, see the B<marked> and B<markedversions:*> formatstrings.

Even if B<--pipe> occurs more than once, the standard input is of course only read once,
but interpreted repeatedly for each occurrence (i.e. if the first --pipe matches, all others will also match).

If you want to use the standard input only for marking but not for selection, you can
choose an expression like

B<eix something -a "-(" --pipe -o "-)">

.TP
The subsequent options define the fields that the pattern should be tested on.
Multiple fields may be specified in one expression (the expression matches
if the pattern matches at least one of the specified fields).
If you do not specify some of these options, the default is chosen according
to some heuristic depending on the form of your pattern.
In most cases, the default match field will be B<--name>, but if your pattern
looks "special" like e.g. "cat/n" or "@set", the default match field will change to
B<--category-name>, B<--set>, B<--description>, B<--homepage>, B<--virtual>, or B<--license>.

The subsequent options define the algorithm by which the match field should be tested

Only one algorithm can be chosen for an expression.
If you do not specify some of these options, the default is chosen according

In most cases, the default will be B<--regex> unless your expression
"looks" like a glob pattern or a substring (in which case the corresponding
algorithm will be the default), or if the pattern has a particular content like
"@set" or "cat/n" which most people would expect to match the whole string or
the beginning of a string, respectively.
Details of the heuristic are specified by the B<DEFAULT_MATCH_ALGORITHM>

and you can also use spaces in I<overlay>.
Overlays added by this option come after overlays added by B<KEEP_VIRTUALS>.

This is similar to adding I<overlay> to B<EXCLUDE_OVERLAY>

and you can also use spaces in I<overlay>.
I<overlay> is considered as a mask. All matching overlays
(even those added by later B<--add-overlay> options)
are excluded from the list of overlays.
The B<PORTDIR> directory is considered as any other overlay which can be excluded

I<overlay> is considered as a mask, i.e. it may contain wildcards.
If I<overlay> does not match anything in the list of overlays,
this option has no effect.
This option is similar to adding the entry "I<overlay> I<method>" at the
end of the B<OVERRIDE_CACHE_METHOD> variable.
It is explicitly admissible to use this option repeatedly to

.\" {{{ OUTPUT
.SH OUTPUT
.SS Slots
In contrast to usual output of versions in emerge, B<eix>
can also print slot names if they are nonempty and different from "0".
Whether this happens is determined by the content of the B<FORMATSTRING>.

If slots are printed, the slot name is separated from the version number
either with a colon, or the slot names are written in braces.
You can choose the preferred modes with the B<COLON_SLOTS> variable.

If B<PROPERTIES> or B<RESTRICT> are set in the ebuild, this is shown
by default in the version string; details can be influenced by setting
of configuration variables.

Some Examples:
.TP
.BR 4.1.1:4.1 "    or    " 4.1.1(4.1)
This is version 4.1.1 which will be installed into the slot "4.1".
.TP

Moreover, a *.tbz2 file (binary package) exists for that version in B<PKGDIR>.

.SS Masking
If you used gentoo for more than a week you're probably going to immediately
recognize the format of the masking in the version-strings.
Nevertheless, we are going to explain it here by some examples.
We describe here of course only the default setting; details can be
influenced by setting of configuration variables.
.TP
.B [P]2.95.3-r8
If a mask for the package was found in the packages-files from your profile, but this
version does not match it, the version is determined to be "masked by profile".
.TP
.B [M]4.0.0_alpha20050213
The version matches a mask from /etc/portage/package.mask, $PORTDIR/profiles/package.mask
or a package.mask from your profile. Portage calls this "masked by package.mask".
.TP
.B [m]4.1.4
The version matches a local mask (from /etc/portage/package.mask), but it is
neither "masked by profile" nor masked in $PORTDIR/profiles/package.mask.
.TP
.B {P}2.95.3-r8
The version was originally "masked by profile", but this was locally changed in /etc/portage/profile/packages.
.TP
.B {M}4.0.0_alpha20050213
The version was originally masked in $PORTDIR/profiles/package.mask, but this was locally changed in /etc/portage/package.unmask.
.TP
.B *3.3.3
This means the version is "masked by missing keyword" but stable for an alien architecture.
.TP
.B ~*3.3.3
This version is "masked by missing keyword", stable on no architecture, but unstable on an alien architecture.
.TP
.B **3.3.3
This means the version is "masked by missing keyword" for all architectures.
.TP
.B (**)3.4.3-r2
That version originally had no keyword, but this was locally changed (in /etc/portage/package.keywords or by ACCEPT_KEYWORDS).
.TP
.B -*3.4.3-r2
That version is "masked by -* keyword" for all architectures (soon obsolete).
.TP
.B -0.8.14
Masked by -ARCH.
.TP
.B ~3.3.5.20050130
The version would be "masked by ~keyword".
.TP
.B (~)3.3.5.20050130
The version was originally "masked by ~keyword", but this was locally changed (in /etc/portage/package.keywords or by ACCEPT_KEYWORDS).
.TP
.B [M]~1.0.9626
The version is both, "masked by package.mask" and "masked by ~keyword".
.TP
.B [m](~)4.1.4-r1
The version was originally only "masked by ~keyword", but this was locally changed (in /etc/portage/package.keywords or by ACCEPT_KEYWORDS).
However, the version is locally masked (in /etc/portage/package.mask).
.TP
.B 3.3.1
Finally, this would be a stable version (which would be stable also without the local settings).
.SS eix-diff
The output of B<eix-diff> is completely determined by configuration variables
(B<DIFF_FORMAT_NEW>, B<DIFF_FORMAT_DELETE>, B<DIFF_FORMAT_CHANGED> and a
lot of variables which - at least in their default setting - is used by them via delayed substitution, see below).
The following explanation by means of examples therefore can only describe
the behavior in the default setting of the current eix version.
Although this default format was not changed for quite a while, no stability of
the defaults is guaranteed for future eix versions.
.TP
.B "[N]   >> foo/bar (~1.0): description of foo/bar"
The package B<foo/bar> has freshly appeared in the tree.
.TP
.B "[*N]  >> foo/bar (1.0): description of foo/bar"
The package B<foo/bar> has freshly appeared in the tree.
Moreover, it has a version (1.0) which could be installed without any sort of unmasking/keywording.
.TP
.B "      << foo/bar ({M}1.0): description of foo/bar"
B<foo/bar> was removed from the tree; the previous version B<1.0>  was masked, but it is currently not masked anymore
(probably, because the developer has cleaned up the package.mask file with the removal of the package).
.TP
.B "[*>]   == foo/bar (1.0): description of foo/bar"
The status of package B<foo/bar> has changed in the tree (for your settings): It has gained a version (1.0) which could be installed without any sort of unmasking/keywords
while in the previous tree foo/bar had no such version. Moreover, the
.B >
means that one slot has gained a higher version. In this case, it is actually the
same change which is responsible for both symbols
.B >
and B<*>.
.TP
.B "[><]  == foo/bar (1.1(1) 2.0(2) -> 1.0(1) 2.1(2)): description"
The status of package B<foo/bar> has changed in the tree (for your settings):
The symbols on the left mean that one slot has gained a higher version which could be installed without modifying masks/keywords,
another slot had such a highest version removed. If you consider the version strings, it becomes clear
that slot B<2> has obtained a new version (the previous stable in this slot was B<2.0>, the new one is B<2.1>),
and that the previously highest stable version B<1.1> of slot B<1> was removed or masked
(the current stable version in this slot is now B<1.0>).
.TP
.B "[UD]  == foo/bar (1.1(1)@01.01.2009; 1.1(1) -> 2.0(2)): description"
The status of package B<foo/bar> has changed in the tree (for your settings):
The symbols on the left mean the one slot you have installed can be upgraded (without modifying masks/keywords),
and that another slot you have installed was removed/masked.
Looking at the versions on the right, it becomes clear that the installed version B<1.1> of Slot B<1>
has been removed or masked, and that there is no other installed version of slot B<1>.
However, a new stable version B<2.0> in slot B<2> has appeared (i.e. slot B<2> did previously not
exist or had no stable version).

Since no version of slot B<2> was installed yet, eix cannot decide in this
situation whether the symbol "B<U>" is really appropriate: Since eix does no
dependency tracking, it does not know whether the new slot would be pulled
in e.g. by your world file, or whether there is only some dependency to your
old slot.
Therefore, the symbol "B<U>" is only shown in this situation if
B<UPGRADE_TO_HIGHEST_SLOT=true> or if the package is listed in
B</etc/portage/package.slot_upgrade_allow>.

Actually, the output
.B "[UD><] == foo/bar ..."
would be more consistent, because in addition one slot has gained a
higher stable version and the highest stable version of another slot was removed,
but since typically this is implicitly implied by "B<U>" or "B<D>", respectively,
it was a design decision of the default setting that if B<U> or B<D> is output
then the symbols
.B <
and
.B >
will never output.
You can of course build a different B<DIFF_FORMAT_HEADER_CHANGED> string
which follows another policy.

.\" {{{ FORMATSTRING
.SH FORMATSTRING
.LP
A formatstring can contain conditional blocks, package properties, colors and
normal strings.
If a formatstring expands to the empty string for a package, also the trailing
newline is not printed.
Thus you can put the whole formatstring into a conditional block to output
only packages matching the conditional.
An example of this wrapping is given below.
.\" {{{ -------- Conditional blocks
.SS Conditional blocks
Conditions are very simple: A property is expanded and the resulting string is
tested against another string. If they are the same, the condition is true and
the block is executed. Conditions can be negated so that the else-part is
executed if the condition is true, and the if-part if the condition is false.
The else-part can be also be completely left out.
.TP
.BR { [ ! ] I<PROPERTY> [ = I<RHS>' ] } I<TCODE> {}
Execute I<TCODE> if the string resulting from expanding I<PROPERTY> is equal to I<RHS>.
The B<!> would negate the behaviour.
I<RHS> is either a property (if enclosed in <>) or a variable (if prefixed with $)
or a string (otherwise or if quoted).
.TP
.BR { [ ! ] I<PROPERTY> [ = I<RHS>] } I<TCODE> {else} I<FCODE> {}
Execute I<TCODE> if the string resulting from expanding I<PROPERTY> is equal to I<STRING>.
If it's not, execute I<FCODE>.

I<PROPERTY> can be either one of the Package properties specified below,
or it can be a variable access.
A variable access has the form B<$>I<VARIABLE>.
I<VARIABLE> need not be initialized; its content defaults to the empty string.

To change I<VARIABLE> during runtime use this syntax:
.TP
.BR { [ ! ] *I<VARIABLE> [ = I<RHS> ] }
This sets the runtime variable B<VARIABLE> to I<STRING>.
With B<!>, the result is either 1 or empty, depending on whether I<STRING> is nonmpty.
If the trailing part (including the B<=> sign) is omitted, there is a special meaning:
B<{*I<VARIABLE}> sets I<VARIABLE> to 1, B<{!*I<VARIABLE>}> sets I<VARIABLE> to the empty string.

For each version, print the content of the configuration/environment variable with name
I<VARIABLE>, interpreting it as a format string.
If the second form is used and at least one slot of the package is nontrivial,
then I<VARSLOTS> is used instead of I<VARIABLE>, and the versions are sorted
according to slots.

To avoid a misunderstanding: It is not possible to enter the required format directly after the colon.
Instead, the required format must be stored in a new variable, and I<VARIABLE> and I<VARSLOTS>
are only the names of these variables.

Useful examples for I<VARIABLE> are B<NAMEVERSION>, B<EQNAMEVERSION>,
B<EQNAMEVERSION>, B<ANAMESLOT>, B<ANAMEASLOT>, B<NAMESLOT>, B<NAMEASLOT> or
B<DATESORT>.
Here, B<ANAMESLOT> and B<ANAMEASLOT> are meant to be used in the second form,
i.e. in B<availableversions:ANAMESLOT:ANAMESLOT> or B<availableversions:ANAMEASLOT:ANAMEASLOT>

Similarly, when the printing is sorted according to slots you can test whether
the current version is the first or last of the current slot or if there is
only one slot at all.
All these properties are empty if the condition is not satisfied, otherwise 1.

An empty I<NAME> means "default" and in contrast to "none" resets output to
default color and no markers.

An empty (or omitted) I<MARKERS> means "none", i.e. no attribute change.
Several marker attributes can be specified simultaneously
(separate them by ",").

Available colors are:
I<default none black red green yellow blue purple cyan gray>

Available marker attributes are:
I<none bold underline blink inverse>

.\" {{{ -------- Example
.SS Examples:

\fBFORMAT='{installed}(yellow,1;underline){else}(yellow,0){}<name>()}\\n' eix ...\fR

If the package B<...> is installed, print the name underlined in bright yellow,
else in normal yellow.

\fBFORMAT='<category>/<name><installedversions:INSTFORMAT>\\n' INSTFORMAT='{first}:{}<version><date:DATEFORMAT>{!last}\\n\\t{}' DATEFORMAT='%x' eix autom*\fR

This will print for every B<autom*> package the category name, and if it is installed,
it will also print the installed versions and the installation dates.
One could have obtained the same result by omitting B<{!last}\\t\\n{}> and writing instead B<{first}:{else}\\t\\n{}>,
since it is of course the same whether B<\\t\\n> is printed at the end of each version except the last
or at the beginning of each version except the first.

B<FORMAT='{downgrade}%{FORMAT_ALL}{}' eix -I>

This will print all installed packages for which there are downgrade recommendations.
Note that B<FORMAT='{downgrade}%{FORMAT}{}'> does not work, because this would be
a self-referential definition in the delayed substitution:
Of course, a variable cannot be defined by an expansion of itself.
For this reason, the content of B<FORMAT> and similar variables has become
very simple since eix-0.13.4: It is just B<%{FORMAT_ALL}>
(and similarly for other variables).
So one can easily insert the full definition of the original value of
B<FORMAT> (which we have done in the above example).

Note that if you want to have compact output in the above example, you cannot
just append the option B<-c>, because appending this option just has the
effect that for the format string the variable B<FORMAT_COMPACT> is used
instead of B<FORMAT>. So, to have compact output, you should use either

B<FORMAT_COMPACT='{downgrade}%{FORMAT_ALL_COMPACT}{}' eix -Ic>

or even simpler and with the same effect:

B<FORMAT='{downgrade}%{FORMAT_ALL_COMPACT}{}' eix -I>

Note that the content of the variable B<EIX_SYNC_CONF> is appended to that file.
By default, the latter expands to B<EIX_SYNC_OPTS> so that also that variable is

Use I<option(s)> as default for eix-sync (in front of all other options).

.BI ! command
Evaluate I<command> within the B<eix-sync> shell script (in the same shell).
I<command> must exit successfully or B<eix-sync> will stop with an error.
(Thus, B<!layman> I<Name> is more or less equivalent to I<Name>.)
Close e.g. the command with "; true" if you want that the exit status
is ignored.

You can use this feature to unpack e.g. an overlay before calling B<layman>
or to apply local fixes after B<layman> was called.

In contrast to earlier eix versions, I<command> does not output anything
(use einfo if you want that), and it is not evaluated within a subshell,
i.e. you can also modify environment variables or begin/end redirection
as you like.
The disadvantage is that you can also easily override internal eix-sync
variables or functions by accident; if in doubt, put your command in
braces (...) to start it in a subshell.
.TP
.BI !! command
This is similar to B<!> I<command> with the difference that
I<command> is unconditionally executed, i.e. even if

It is meant to set environment variables for the other programs.
.TP
.BI ~ command
This is only important if eix-sync options B<-s> or B<-2> are used.
In this case, I<command> will be executed before the first call of B<rsync>;
the output of I<command> is evaluated within the B<eix-sync> shell.
If I<command> or the evaluation of its output are not successful,
B<eix-sync> will stop with an error.
This can be used to execute e.g. B<keychain> and to return the content of
the appropriate I<~/.keychain/*-sh> file or to return export-commands for
the current B<SSH_AUTH_SOCK> and B<SSH_AGENT_PID>.
It is also admissible that the output of I<command> is a command which
modifies the variables B<PORTAGE_RSYNC_OPTS>, B<PORTAGE_RSYNC_EXTRA_OPTS>,
B<PORTDIR>, B<PORTDIR_SERVER>, B<PORTDIR_CLIENT>, B<SERVER>, or B<CLIENT>.

This can make sense if you want to use cache method B<metadata-flat>
for that overlay and want to make sure that this metadata cache is up-to-date.
The disadvantage is that this B<egencache> command is executed even if
"local" was not changed (which is usually the case for local repositories).
.TP
.B !egencache --repo=foo --update
Update the metadata cache of the overlay with repository name "foo";
this makes sense if you had earlier a line B<foo> or a line B<!command to update foo>

You can use a shell-like syntax to set the following variables.
In particular, you can source other files and you can use auxiliary variables to set other variables.

However, if you use auxiliary variables as usual, you will only see
the substituted values with --dump or --dump-defaults and you cannot
replace the inserted values e.g. by setting them in the environment.

For this reason, you can refer to variables besides the usual shell-way also
in the syntax B<%{>I<VARIABLE>B<}> (the braces here are not optional).
This means that the substitution is delayed until all configuration files
and environment variables are read, and the substitution will not show up
with --dump or --dump-defaults.

This concept is called delayed substitution/reference, and provides also
some additional features:

This way you can have different defaults for these programs.

For example, the delayed reference B<%{*>I<VARIABLE>B<}> will insert

If you want to substitute several variables completely differently,
depending on the state of a (Boolean) variable, you can use
conditional blocks.

This is somewhat analogous to Conditional Blocks in FORMATSTRING:
If the referenced variable expands finally to the Boolean value true
(B<true>/B<1>/B<yes>/B<y>/B<on>) (resp. to something nonempty if you
preceed I<VARIABLE> with an additional B<?>) the result is true
and the corresponding block of the string is expanded.
Conditions can be negated so that the else-part is expanded if the
condition is true, and the if-part if the condition is false.
The else-part can be also be completely left out.
The special variable names B<*>I<VARIABLE> (instead of I<VARIABLE>)
can also be used in these conditionals.

Note that any variables you add for delayed substitution are only output
with --dump if they are actually used (i.e. referenced in some of the other variables).
If you want to output them anyway, e.g. for comments or easier later change,
you can collect references to them in the B<DUMMY> variable.

The following variables do not contain those which are used only in delayed references.
To get a full description of the latter (and of the defaults), please use B<eix --dump>.

The content of B<EIX_SYNC_CONF> is appended to the file B<@SYSCONFDIR/eix-sync.conf>
See the description of that file for details.
By default, B<EIX_SYNC_CONF> is a delayed substitution of B<EIX_SYNC_OPTS> so
that typically you can also use B<EIX_SYNC_OPTS> with the same purpose.
Be aware that if one of these variables is compromised, almost anything can
happen if you call B<eix-sync> with root permissions, so be aware of security
risks! Quote these variables carefully if you use them!

.TP
.BR EIX_REMOTE_OPTS ", " EIX_LAYMAN_OPTS ", " EIX_TEST_OBSOLETE_OPTS " " (string)

B<eix-remote>, B<eix-layman>, and B<eix-test-obsolete>, respectively.
So be sure to quote these variables correctly and be aware of security risks!

.TP
.BR EIXRC_SOURCE " " (string)
This path is prepended to source commands in @SYSCONFDIR@/eixrc.
It is meant to be set in the environment but can also be set in @SYSCONFDIR@/eixrc.
In the latter case, it will override the setting from the environment as soon as it is read until all files are sourced.
Note that when this variable takes effect, no delayed substitution is performed yet.

.TP
.BR EIX_PREFIX " " (prefix-string) " (prefix-string means that this is a string, but if it has the value '/' it is changed to '')"

This is essentially meant to be set in the environment if you want to use a chroot:
It is prefixed to the path where @SYSCONFDIR@/eixrc is searched.
If it is unset, the value of the environment variable B<PORTAGE_CONFIGROOT>
is prefixed.
The default value (typically empty) of this variable is used, if neither is
set in the environment.

Moreover, this variable is used for delayed substitution to determine
the prefix of a lot of paths in the subsequent variables;
see B<eix --dump> to see in detail in which other variables it occurs.
In the current default, it influences all paths with the following exceptions:

.TP
.BR EPREFIX " " (prefix-string)
The default value of this variable stems from EIX_PREFIX, appended with
a configure-specific default (for prefix-portage).
This variable has no meaning on its own, but it is used for
delayed substitution to determine the prefix of a lot of paths in the
subsequent variables (if their default is not changed);
see B<eix --dump> to see in detail in which other variables it occurs.
In the current default, it influences all paths with the following exceptions:

.B @BINDIR@/eix-functions.sh

.B ~/.eixrc

.BR "cachefile path" "(s) passed in the commandline"

.BR PORTAGE_PROFILE " (only the variable, not the link)"

.B PORTDIR

.B Overlay paths

The last three items can be modified by B<EPREFIX_TREE>.

The purpose of B<EPREFIX> is to allow a quasi-chroot analogously to prefix-portage.
Note that as a prefix-portage user you will want to use option -e in eix-sync.
.TP
.BR ROOT " " (prefix-string)
.TP
.BR EPREFIX_TREE " " (prefix-string)
.TP
.BR EPREFIX_ROOT " " (prefix-string)

These are actually not internal variables of eix but they are just used for
delayed substitution for the following variables analogously to B<EPREFIX>
(see above).

The purpose of B<ROOT> is to follow roughly portage's usage of this variable.
Note that variables in /etc/make.conf do not influence eix configuration variables.
In particular, a B<ROOT=>I<something> command in /etc/make.conf does not influence eix.
You must set it instead in the environment or in an eix configuration file.

You can easily customize to which paths the B<EPREFIX> or B<ROOT> variables apply:
Simply use in the appropriate following variables either the delayed references
B<%{EPREFIX}>, B<%{ROOT}>, nothing, or B<%{EPREFIX_ROOT}> (which in turn is
defined as a delayed reference so that you can easily change what to do if
B<EPREFIX> and B<ROOT> are both nonempty: You might e.g. concatenate these
paths or use only one of them).
You can of course also use other variables as delayed references,
e.g. you might want to set

.B EIX_CACHEFILE="%{EPREFIX_PROFILE}@EIX_CACHEFILE@"

if you feel that the eix cachefile should depend (only) on the profile root.
.TP
.BR PORTAGE_CONFIGROOT " " (prefix-string)
This path is prepended to the /etc paths.
The purpose is to respect PORTAGE_CONFIGROOT in an analogous way portage does.
If you set this variable in the environment it will also change the path
where @SYSCONFDIR@/eixrc is searched. (Note that reading @SYSCONFDIR@/eixrc occurs before
delayed substitution takes effect.)

.TP

.TP
.BR EPREFIX_OVERLAYS " " (prefix-string)

.TP
.BR EPREFIX_PROFILE " " (prefix-string)

.TP
.BR EPREFIX_VIRTUAL " " (prefix-string)
This is prepended to overlays in the eix database to test whether they exist.

.TP
.BR EIX_CACHEFILE " " (string)
The eix cachefile (usually B<%{EPREFIX}@EIX_CACHEFILE@>).

.TP
.BR EIX_WORLD " " (string)
The file eix considers as the world file. Note that usually
this file is only readable if you are a member of the portage group.
To avoid needing this permissions you can use B<SAVE_WORLD>.

.TP
.BR EIX_WORLD_SETS " " (string)
The file eix considers as the world_sets file.
The same remarks as for B<EIX_WORLD> hold true.

.TP
.BR EIX_LOCAL_SETS " " "(string list)" "(the meaning of string list is explained in the next paragraph)"
This is a list of directories which contain locally defined sets.
The directories are read in the given order; files with set-names which have
been read earlier are ignored: In this sense earlier entries in
B<EIX_LOCAL_SETS> take precedence over later entries.

Relative directories (i.e. those not starting with B</>) are understood relative to B<$PORTDIR>.
Entries in B<EIX_LOCAL_SETS> starting with the special symbol B<*> are interpreted in a special way:
They are interpreted as several entries, the B<*> symbol being replaced successively by the paths
to the overlays in reverse order (the latter in view of the fact that in a sense
earlier entries of B<EIX_LOCAL_SETS> override later entries while for
B<PORTDIR_OVERLAY> one expects the converse).

The default of this variable contains B</etc/portage/sets>, B</etc/portage/sets.eix>, B<sets>
(i.e. roughly B<${PORTDIR}/sets> according to the previous paragraph),
B<*/sets> (i.e. roughly B<${PORTIDR_OVERLAY}/sets> according to the previous paragraph)
as well as B<%{EIX_LOCAL_SETS_ADD}>.
The reason for the latter is that you can just add additional directories
to the variable B<%{EIX_LOCAL_SETS_ADD}> in B<@SYSCONFDIR@/eixrc>.
Reasons why you might want to do this is e.g. if you defined another multiset
directory (e.g. for some overlay or for treatment with "world-candidate = False") in
/etc/portage/sets.conf or in the sets.conf file of some overlay.

For all string list variables, the possible separators between different entries are [ \\t\\r\\n].
If you want to use such a separator within an entry, you have to escape it by B<\\>.
Moreover, all B<\\> symbols have to be escaped analogously, since the escapes of escapes
and escapes of the separator symbols are removed.
If you want to insert a variable "as-is", you can make use of delayed substitution:
B<%{\\>I<VAR>B<}> will insert the value of I<VAR> with all symbols from [\\ \\t\\r\\n] being escaped.
(See delayed substitution for more details).

.TP
.BR EAPI_REGEX
This regular expression matches the recognized EAPIs in .ebuild suffixes
which will be recognized according to GLEP 55.
You might need to modify this expression locally according to the installed
portage version (in order to make sure that the installed portage can parse
the corresponding EAPIs).
An exceptional case is if that variable is empty: In this case all EAPI-suffixed
ebuilds are ignored.

.TP
.BR SAVE_WORLD " " (true / false)
If you set this to true, the information of your world file is stored in @EIX_CACHEFILE@.
Note that this means that anybody who can read this file has the information about
the content of your world file.
Make sure that this is really what you want if you set this to true.

.TP
.BR CURRENT_WORLD " " (true / false)
If false, then the world file information stored in @EIX_CACHEFILE@ is used,
even if your current world file is readable.
Otherwise, your current world file (if it is readable) overrides that information.

.TP
.BR SKIP_PERMISSION_TESTS " " (true / false)
If B<true>, eix-update will not check for groups and permissions.
You will probably want to set this to B<true> if you have a more sophisticated
permission setup on your system (NSS/LDAP, acl, pam-related stuff, ...)
in which case eix might guess wrong permissions.
The only negative side effect is that eix-update does not break with an error
at the beginning but will stop with a (perhaps misleading) error message when
trying to access the cache file without proper permissions.

.TP
.BR EBUILD_USER ", " EBUILD_GROUP ", " EBUILD_UID ", " EBUILD_GID
These variables determine the permissions for cache methods B<ebuild>/B<ebuild*>.
See these cache methods for more details

.TP
.BR PORTAGE_ROOTPATH ", " PORTAGE_BIN_PATH
If nonempty, these variables are passed unchanged to ebuild.sh for cache method B<ebuild*>.
Note that ebuild.sh uses these variables to calculate the PATH, so this may be a severe security issue.

.TP
.BR NOFOUND_STATUS " " (integer)
This value is used as exit status if there are 0 matches.
The value of B<COUNT_ONLY_PRINTED> is honoured.

.TP
.BR MOREFOUND_STATUS " " (integer)
This value is used as exit status if there are 2 or more matches.
The value of B<COUNT_ONLY_PRINTED> is honoured.

.TP
.BR QUICKMODE " " (true / false)
If true, eix and eix-diff will use B<--quick> by default.

.TP
.BR CAREMODE " " (true / false)
If true, eix and eix-diff will use B<--care>.

.TP
.BR QUIETMODE " " (true / false)
If true, eix and eix-diff will use B<--quiet> by default.

.TP
.BR PRINT_APPEND " " (string)
This string is appended to the output of --print.
Standard escape sequences in this string like \\n are interpreted.
The default is a newline for reasonable output in an interactive shell.
Note that command substitution in shell scripts removes all trailing spaces
so that this newline does not harm (but trailing spaces of the variable would
be removed in the shell script anyway).
Hence, in order to read variables from eix in a shell script without omitting
trailing spaces, you should use a visible symbol for PRINT_APPEND and use
for instance something like
B<VAR="`PRINT_APPEND=x eix --print VAR`" ; VAR="${VAR%x}">

.TP
.BR NEWLINE " " (true / false)
If true, eix will print a newline after each version for which the formatstring outputs something.
You will find B<true> convenient if you use trivial formatstrings which output only one line
(unless you want to add the newline manually to the formatstring).
However, if you use a formatstring which outputs versions in separate lines,
and only those versions are output for which certain tests succeed,
it might be rather cumbersome to keep track in the formatstring whether you must output a newline or
whether this will happen automatically.
In such cases you should should avoid the headache and put B<NEWLINE=false>.
The default formatstrings of eix produce correct output for both settings
(by checking the value of B<NEWLINE> and outputting the newline only if it is required).

Unless you need to support formatstring which you had previously written,
I recommend to leave the default B<NEWLINE=false> and to add manually a B<\\n>
(or an explicit newline) at the end of your formatstring.
Moreover, if you had written formatstrings, I recommend to upgrade them to
output this newline instead of setting B<NEWLINE=true>; this option really
just exists for backward compatibility and might be removed in future versions
of eix.

.TP
.BR DEFAULT_FORMAT " " (normal / compact / verbose)
Defines whether B<--compact> or B<--verbose> is on by default.

.TP
.BR DIFF_ONLY_INSTALLED " " (true / false)
If true, eix-diff will only consider version changes for installed packages.

.TP
.BR DIFF_NO_SLOTS " " (true / false)
If true, eix-diff will not consider slots for version changes.

.TP
.BR DIFF_SEPARATE_DELETED " " (true / false)
If true, eix-diff will print deleted packages in a section on their own.
Otherwise, eix-diff will mix deleted and changed packages "alphabetically".

.TP
.BR DIFF_PRINT_HEADER " " (true / false)
If true, eix-diff will print a header info line.

.TP
.BR NO_RESTRICTIONS " " (true / false)
If false, RESTRICTION and PROPERTIES data is output.

.TP
.BR RESTRICT_INSTALLED " " (true / false)
If true, fetch and mirror restrictions for installed versions are calculated.

.TP
.BR CARE_RESTRICT_INSTALLED " " (true / false)
If true, fetch and mirror restrictions for installed versions are
always fetched from disk, even if it could be read from a corresponding version.
This is slower but more reliable, i.e. it will also find out whether restrictions were changed.

.TP
.BR FORMAT ", " FORMAT_COMPACT ", " FORMAT_VERBOSE " " (string)
Define the normal, compact and verbose layout for results printed by B<eix>.
See B<FORMATSTRING>.
Since eix-0.13.4 these variables just expand to delayed substitution of the
variables B<FORMAT_ALL>, B<FORMAT_ALL_COMPACT>, or B<FORMAT_ALL_VERBOSE>,
respectively.
The intention of this simple definition is that it is very easy to refer
to the default definition when you change the definition of B<FORMAT>.

.TP
.BR DIFF_FORMAT_NEW ", " DIFF_FORMAT_DELETE ", " DIFF_FORMAT_CHANGED " " (string)
Define the format for packages that were added, removed or for which the highest
stable versions has changed. This is only used by B<eix-diff>.
See B<FORMATSTRING>.
Since eix-0.13.4 these variables just expand to delayed substitution of the
variables B<DIFF_FORMAT_ALL_NEW>, B<DIFF_FORMAT_ALL_DELETE>, or
B<DIFF_FORMAT_ALL_CHANGED>, respectively.

.TP
.BR FORMAT_INSTALLATION_DATE ", " FORMAT_SHORT_INSTALLATION_DATE
Define the strftime() format used to print the installation date (in normal resp. short form).

.TP
.BR FORMAT_INSTALLED_USE
Define the printf-like format used to print useflags of installed packages.
If this string is empty, the processing is slightly faster since then these data are not read.

.TP
.BR FORMAT_BEFORE_KEYWORDS ", " FORMAT_AFTER_KEYWORDS ", " FORMAT_BEFORE_EFFECTIVE_KEYWORDS ", " FORMAT_AFTER_EFFECTIVE_KEYWORDS
These strings are printed before/after the (effective) KEYWORDS string for a version is printed.

.TP
.BR FORMAT_BEFORE_SET_USE ", " FORMAT_AFTER_SET_USE ", " FORMAT_BEFORE_UNSET_USE ", " FORMAT_AFTER_UNSET_USE
These strings are printed before/after the set/unset USE flags of installed versions are printed.

.TP
.BR FORCE_USECOLORS " " (true / false)
Use colors even when stdout is not a terminal.

.TP
.BR FORCE_PERCENTAGE " " (true / false)
Show the percentage progress even when stdout is not a terminal.

.TP
.BR STYLE_VERSION_SORTED " " (true / false)
Defines whether B<--versionsort> is on by default.

.TP
.BR STYLE_VERSION_LINES " " (true / false)
Defines whether B<--versionlines> is on by default.

.TP
.BR DUP_PACKAGES_ONLY_OVERLAYS " " (true / false)
Defines whether duplicate package checks occur only among overlays, i.e. a
package is only considered as duplicate if it occurs in at least two
different overlays.

.TP
.BR DUP_VERSIONS_ONLY_OVERLAYS " " (true / false)
Defines whether duplicate version checks occur only among overlays, i.e. a
version is only considered as duplicate if it occurs at least twice in
overlays.

.TP
.BR DEFAULT_IS_OR " " (true / false)
If several pattern arguments occur without logical concatenation (-a or -o),
eix assumes an implicit concatenation. If this variable is true, it assumes
that this concatenation is -o (or), otherwise -a (and).

.TP
.BR OVERLAYS_LIST " " (all / all-if-used / all-used / all-used-renumbered / no)
People with many different overlays do not want to see all overlays listed at
the end but only those which are really used. Here, you can customize the
behaviour. The value is interpreted as follows:
.TP
.SS
.BR all-if-used / if-used / if
Display all overlays, if at least one is used. This was the default behaviour
before eix-0.6.0.
.TP
.SS
.BR used-renumbered / renumber / renumbered / number
Display only the overlays actually used, numbering them "correctly"
(i.e. if only two overlays are needed, number them [1] and [2]).
The disadvantage is that overlays get different numbers for different queries.
However, the order of the numbering is consistent.
.TP
.SS
.BR all-used / only-used / used
Display only the overlays actually used, keeping the numbering consistent
over all queries (on the same database).
.TP
.SS
.BR no / false
Never display a list of overlays.
.TP
.SS
.BR "" "anything else"
List all overlays for every query (even if not even one is needed).

.TP
.BR LEVENSHTEIN_DISTANCE " " (integer)
Set default levenshtein-distance.

.TP
.BR EXCLUDE_OVERLAY " " "(string list)"
Set a list of wildcard patterns for overlay paths that are excluded from the index.
See the B<eix-update> option B<--exclude-overlay>.

.TP
.BR ADD_OVERLAY " " "(string list)"
Set a list of overlays that are added to the index.
See the B<eix-update> option B<--add-overlay>.

.TP
.BR EXPORT_PORTDIR_OVERLAY " " (true / false)
If true and overlays are excluded/added, a correspondingly modified
B<PORTDIR_OVERLAY> is exported.
This means that in a sense also the corresponding eclasses of these overlay
are excluded/added for cache methods eix and eix*.

.TP
.BR CACHE_METHOD_PARSE " " (string)
This string is appended to all cache methods using parse/parse*/ebuild/ebuild*.
Its default contains B<#metadata-flat>.
Unless you have a very special setup this is always what you want:
It means that if current metadata is available for the ebuild, this is used instead of
parsing/executing the ebuild.
The latter is in principle not completely reliable (parsing) or rather slow (executing),
i.e. the metadata (if available and up-to-date) is always preferable.

.TP
.BR PORTDIR_CACHE_METHOD ", " OVERLAY_CACHE_METHOD " " (string)
Set the type of the cache used by portage and for overlays.
B<PORTDIR_CACHE_METHOD> defaults to I<@PORTDIR_CACHE_METHOD@>,
B<OVERLAY_CACHE_METHOD> to I<parse|ebuild*>.

B<Security Warning:>
If you do not completely trust the .ebuilds in your overlays,
you should set B<OVERLAY_CACHE_METHOD=parse>.

You might want to set temporarily B<OVERLAY_CACHE_METHOD=eix*::~> -
as will be explained later, eix will then take by default the overlay data
from the previous eix database.

The available cache methods are described below.
You might want to specify a different cache method only for some overlays.
This can be done with the following variables:

.TP
.BR CACHE_METHOD ", " OVERRIDE_CACHE_METHOD " " "(string list)"
These variables are string lists of the form "I<overlay> I<method> I<overlay> I<method> ...".
The cache method of I<overlay> is set to the subsequent I<method>,
thus overriding the default settings of B<OVERLAY_CACHE_METHOD>
(or of B<PORTDIR_CACHE_METHOD> if I<overlay> is the B<PORTDIR> directory).
I<overlay> is interpreted as a wildcard pattern which should match the I<path> (symbolic links resolved) of the overlay
(it is not possible to refer to repository's name here - you must use the true I<path>).
Later entries override earlier ones: The last matching entry takes precedence.

The difference between B<CACHE_METHOD> and B<OVERRIDE_CACHE_METHOD> is that
the former applies immediately while the latter can also be used to
extend/override the changes made implicitly if B<KEEP_VIRTUALS> is used
(see below).

The default definitions of B<CACHE_METHOD> and B<OVERRIDE_CACHE_METHOD>
contain B<%{ADD_CACHE_METHOD}> and B<%{ADD_OVERRIDE_CACHE_METHOD}>, respectively.
According to the mechanism of delayed substitution explained in another section,
this means that the variables B<ADD_CACHE_METHOD> or
B<ADD_OVERRIDE_CACHE_METHOD> can also be used to override the cache method locally.
If you modify B<CACHE_METHOD> or B<OVERRIDE_CACHE_METHOD> in B<@SYSCONFDIR@/eixrc>,
it is recommended to add " B<%{ADD_CACHE_METHOD}>" or
" B<%{ADD_OVERRIDE_CACHE_METHOD}>" (note the space in front of B<%>)
at the end of the respective modified definitions, so that these variables
can still be used for local overriding.

The following cache methods are available:
.TP
.SS
.BR metadata-flat " or " metadata-flat:I<PATH>
Use the metadata-cache located inside the portage-tree ($PORTDIR/metadata/cache).
This is the default method which will always work if the portage tree is readable
when you run eix-update.

If you provide I<PATH>, it overrides the above path; in this case, it must be
the full path (i.e. no prefix is used). You might want to provide I<PATH> if
you use some package manager to generate the metadata in the corresponding
directory.
.TP
.SS
.BR metadata-assign " or " metadata-assign:I<PATH>
This is similar to B<metadata-flat> with the difference that the files within
the metadata cache are expected to be in an "assignment format"
(TYPE=value) which is the case in some alt-gentoo trees.
.TP
.SS
.B sqlite
This is an extremely fast cache method if you are using portage with the
sqlite backend, see I<http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/Portage_SQLite_Cache>
(originally this was described in
I<http://gentoo-wiki.com/TIP_speed_up_portage_with_sqlite>
which might be still accessible at
I<http://gentoo-wiki.info/TIP_speed_up_portage_with_sqlite>).
Note that in contrast to the default B<metadata> cache method you must
use B<emerge --metadata> before you call B<eix-update> with this method.

Since the support of this cache method requires B<sqlite> to be installed,
this method is not necessarily compiled in.
You must have emerged B<eix> with the appropriate USE flag
(or in a manual installation used I<./configure --with-sqlite>
before compilation) if you want support for this method.

As for all other cache methods, only those categories enabled by
profile/category (in the main tree or some overlay) are read.
If you do not want this, use B<sqlite*> (see below).
.TP
.SS
.B sqlite*
This is analogous to the cache method B<eix> with the difference that
all categories found in I<FILE> are added, even those categories which
were not enabled by some profile/categories file.
.TP
.SS
.B " cdb"
Use this if you are using <portage-2.1 and the cdb-module from
I<http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-261580.html> as
cache-backend for portage (cdb with cpickle'd dictionaries as values).
Note that in contrast to the default B<metadata-*> cache methods you must
use B<emerge --metadata> before you call B<eix-update> with this method.
.TP
.SS
.BR flat " or " flat:I<PATH>
This is similar to B<metadata-flat> with the difference that the metadata is
expected in the directory I<PATH>I<${PORTAGE_OR_OVERLAY_DIR}>.
If I<PATH> is omitted, it defaults to B</var/cache/edb/dep>.

You can use this cache method with <portage-2.1 and the default backend.
.TP
.SS
.BR assign " or " assign:I<PATH>
This is analogous to B<flat> with the difference that the files are
expected to be in an "assignment format" (TYPE=value).
This is the case if you use portage-2.1 with the default backend.

If you are using >=portage-2.1 and the default backend,
you might want to use this one if you do not have access to the portage
tree when you run eix-update.
Note that in contrast to the default B<metadata-*> cache methods you must
run B<emerge --metadata> before you call B<eix-update> with this method.
You will probably want to use a corresponding option in eix-sync in this case.
.TP
.SS
.BR repo-flat " or " repo-flat:I<PATH> " or " repo-assign " or " repo-assign:I<PATH>
This is analogous to B<flat>/B<assign> with the difference that the metadata is
expected in the directory I<PATH>B</>I<${repo_name}>.
If I<${repo_name}> is empty, the name B<x->I<XXX> is assumed where I<XXX>
is the last nonzero path component of the portage/overlay directory.
This corresponds to the naming scheme of paludis.
If this gives a wrong path for some overlay, you can still manually override
this with e.g.
.BI "OVERRIDE_CACHE_METHOD='" bad_overlay " " metadata-assign ":" correct_path "'".
.TP
.SS
.BR parse "[" # metadata-method "]..."
Get the information from the ebuilds, parsing it using some heuristics.
Hence, this method has no security risk but possibly some other problems.
For example, if variables are only set in eclasses, this method will not see them.
Examples of problems with this method is missing SLOT information for
typical ebuilds from kde-base or stupid version numbers for gcc cross-compilers.
This is the cache-method B<none> from older eix versions (before 0.11.1).

It is optionally possible to append one or several strings of the form
B<#>I<metadata-method> where I<metadata-method> is any of the above mentioned
cache methods (excluding B<sqlite> and B<cdb>).
In this case, the metadata-methods are used to check whether they contain
newer information than the ebuild.
If this is the case, the metadata is used instead of the ebuild
(the first matching metadata wins).

Usually this is what you want, especially for overlays, since the metadata
is more reliable than the results of cache method B<parse>.
Of course, this is only useful if the overlay I<foo> contains metadata
which is regularly updated by the overlay maintainer using

.B egencache --repo=I<foo> --update

(whether this is done for layman overlays depends on the overlay maintainer;
for your local overlays you can of course use the above command manually).

Since this is usually what you want, the string in B<CACHE_METHOD_PARSE>
is appended by default to the cache method B<parse>.

Of course, if you know in advance that the metadata information of the
overlay is up-to-date, it is (slightly) faster to use directly to use
the corresponding metadata method (usually B<metadata-flat>).
The latter makes sense if you e.g. call B<egencache> from a script which you
use to sync the overlay (e.g. in eix-sync).
.TP
.SS
.BR parse* "[" # "metadata-method]..."
This is essentially the same as cache method B<parse> with the difference
that variables are not expanded in variable definitions.
This is the cache-method B<none*> from older eix versions (before 0.11.1)
and cache-method B<none> from very old eix versions (before 0.7.1)
.TP
.SS
.BR ebuild "[" # "metadata-method]..."
If no portage cache is available (e.g. for overlays)
this is the most compatible but also the slowest method.
The information is obtained via "/usr/bin/ebuild ... depend" from the ebuild.
Since all ebuilds will get executed by bash, this may be a security risk
if you do not trust all ".ebuild" scripts or your environment variables.
B<eix-update> will attempt to change the user/group to
B<EBUILD_USER>/B<EBUILD_GROUP> (using B<EBUILD_UID>/B<EBUILD_GID> if the former
makes no sense) before executing the ebuild.
Intentionally, the environment is not cleared before the actual execution
so that you can pass further variables to the ebuild.
However, this can also lead to unexpected behaviour or even a security risk
since many bash scripts may be tricked with strange environments.
Use B<env -i eix-update> when this causes problems.

.B Do not use this method if you do not completely trust all .ebuilds for which the method applies!

Concerning the optional appendices B<#>I<metadata-method>, see the description of the cache method B<parse>.
Note that if corresponding metadata is available this will be essentially faster than executing the ebuild.
.TP
.SS
.BR ebuild* "[" # "metadata-method]..."
This is a slightly faster and slightly less compatible version of B<ebuild>:
The information is obtained via the undocumented "/usr/lib/portage/ebuild.sh".
Thus, instead of executing a python program for each ".ebuild" as for
cache-method B<ebuild>, "only" a lengthy shell-script and the ebuild itself
is executed (hence, also this method is unsafe if you do not trust all
".ebuild" scripts).
Most environment variables except for portage variables and PATH are cleared;
PORTAGE_BIN_PATH and PORTAGE_ROOTPATH are exported (be aware that ebuild.sh
uses these to calculate the PATH, so this may be a severe security issue);
some .ebuild-specific variables like $P are set when the ebuild is executed.
This method is not quite as compatible as the method B<ebuild>, and its
success may depend more on the portage version.
However, this method is considerably faster than B<ebuild> and stable
enough to treat e.g. typical ebuilds from kde-base.

.B Do not use this method if you do not completely trust all .ebuilds for which the method applies!
.TP
.SS
.BR parse|ebuild ", " parse*|ebuild ", " parse|ebuild* ", " parse*|ebuild*  " [" # "metadata-method]..."
This is a mixture of B<parse>/B<parse*> and B<ebuild>/B<ebuild*>.
Each ebuild is first scanned as with method B<parse>/B<parse*>.
If the obtained result has missing information or appears strange,
the ebuild is treated as with cache method B<ebuild>/B<ebuild*>.
As a rule of thumb, this method is much faster than B<ebuild>/B<ebuild*>
but still much slower than B<parse>/B<parse*>.
It has the same security risks as B<ebuild>/B<ebuild*>, of course.

.B Do not use this method if you do not completely trust all .ebuilds for which the method applies!
.TP
.SS
.BR eix "  or   "  eix:I<FILE> "  or  " eix:I<FILE>:I<overlay>
Use the cachefile I<FILE> previously generated by B<eix-update>.
If omitted or empty, I<FILE> defaults to @EIX_CACHEFILE@.

As for all other cache methods, only those categories enabled by
profile/category (in the main tree or some overlay) are read.
If you do not want this, use B<eix*> (see below).

If I<overlay> is not given or empty, then only the "main" tree in I<FILE> is read -
overlays within I<FILE> are ignored.
Otherwise only the part corresponding to I<overlay> is read from I<FILE>.
Here, "corresponding" means the first overlay from I<FILE> matching the wildcard pattern I<overlay> is used.
"Matching" means that first the label is tested, then the path and finally also the number
of the overlay within I<FILE>. Note that I<overlay> has in general no relation with the current overlay
names or order - only the names/order stored in I<FILE> play a role here.

There are two exceptional values for I<overlay> which are treated by different rules:

If I<overlay> has the special value "~", then the name of the current overlay label
is used implicitly as the I<overlay> argument;
If the current overlay label is empty or does not match, then the current overlay path is used instead.

If I<overlay> has the special value "*", then B<all> overlays in I<FILE> are read.
Note this is usually not what you want since it means that if I<FILE> originally contained several overlays,
this overlay structure will appear "flattened".
.TP
.SS
.BR eix* "  or   "  eix*:I<FILE> "  or  " eix*:I<FILE>:I<overlay>
This is analogous to the cache method B<eix> with the difference that
all categories found in I<FILE> are added, even those categories which
were not enabled by some profile/categories file.

This cache method is useful if I<FILE> contains information for some
overlay directory for which the corresponding profile/categories on
the local machine is unknown or not necessarily up-to-date.

This is used for B<eix-remote>.

Note that in particular with B<PORTDIR_CACHE_METHOD="eix*::~">,
the overlay data is by default just "copied" from the previous eix cachefile.
.TP
.BR KEEP_VIRTUALS " " (true / false)
If true, eix-update will keep all virtual overlays from the previous database
if that existed.
This has the same effect as appending for each virtual overlay of the previous
database the entry "I<overlay-name>" to B<ADD_OVERLAY> and appending a
corresponding entry "I<overlay> eix*::I<overlay>" to B<CACHE_METHOD>.
Note that this means that this option might override settings made in
B<CACHE_METHOD>, but it might be overridden by settings from
B<OVERRIDE_CACHE_METHOD>.
.TP
.BR REPO_NAMES
This variables is a string list of the form "I<dir-pattern> I<overlay-label> I<dir-pattern> I<overlay-label> ...".
When a new cachefile is created, the overlay matching I<dir-pattern> obtains the label I<overlay-label>,
independent of the content of its profiles/repo_name file.
This variable can also associate label names to virtual overlays which do not possess such a file.
In particular, this variable also overrides overlay labels set by KEEP_VIRTUALS.
Later entries override earlier ones: The last matching entry takes precedence.
.TP
.BR LOCAL_PORTAGE_CONFIG " " (true / false)
If false, /etc/portage and B<ACCEPT_KEYWORDS> (from make.conf or the environment) are ignored.
Since eix-0.7.9, it is recommended to leave this value "true",
because setting it to "false" will just hide some informations.
.TP
.BR ALWAYS_ACCEPT_KEYWORDS " " (true / false)
If true, B<ACCEPT_KEYWORDS> is used even without B<LOCAL_PORTAGE_CONFIG>,
e.g. to determine the `default' stability.
.TP
.BR UPGRADE_LOCAL_MODE " " (+ " or " local / - " or " non-local "/anything else" )
If this variable is B<+> / B<->, the B<--upgrade> option of eix will always
match as if B<LOCAL_PORTAGE_CONFIG> was set to B<true> / B<false>.
.TP
.BR RECOMMEND_LOCAL_MODE " " (+ "  or " local / - " or " non-local "/anything else" )
If this variable is B<+> / B<-> the upgrade/downgrade recommendations
as well as in eix-diff the tests for version changes will act as is
B<LOCAL_PORTAGE_CONFIG> was set to B<true> / B<false>.
.TP
.BR UPGRADE_TO_HIGHEST_SLOT " " (true / false)
If true, all upgrade tests will give a positive result for an installed
package for which not the slot with the best stable version is installed.
Exceptions to this general policy can be specified in
B</etc/portage/package.slot_upgrade_forbid> or
B</etc/portage/package.slot_upgrade_allow>, respectively.
.TP
.BR RECURSIVE_SETS " " (true / false)
If true, then sets and packages which are contained in an included set
are considered as part of the parent set.
.TP
.BR PRINT_EFFECTIVE_KEYWORDS " " (true / false)
If B<PRINT_KEYWORDS> is in effect and this variable is true
and the KEYWORD of a version is modified by the profile,
then the effective keywords (according to the profile) is printed
after the KEYWORDS stored in the ebuild.
.TP
.BR XML_KEYWORDS (full / effective / both / true / full* / effective* / none / false)
With --xml, this variable decides whether full/effective (or both) types of B<KEYWORDS> are printed for each versions.
Here, "full" is the B<KEYWORDS> string as specified in the ebuild and "effective" means its modification by the profile.
The values B<full*>/B<effective*> are similar to B<full>/B<effective>, but both types are printed if their values differ.
B<true>/B<false> are equivalent to B<full*>/B<none>.
.TP
.BR XML_OVERLAY " " (true / false)
With --xml, this variable decides whether the overlay (i.e. its path) is output for each version.
This has no influence for versions from overlays without label (repository name):
For those versions the overlay is output unconditionally.
.TP
.BR SORT_INST_USE_ALPHA " " (true / false)
If B<true>, print the useflags of installed packages in alphabetical order.
Otherwise, first those useflags are printed (in alphabetical order) which
were set when the package was emerged, then the others are printed
(in alphabetical order).
.TP
.BR CHECK_INSTALLED_OVERLAYS " " (true / false / repository)
If B<true>, always check from which overlay a package was installed.
If B<false>, only packages with versions in at least two trees are checked,
i.e. only packages for which it appears reasonable from the database that
it might have been installed from a different overlay.
However, this information might be false if such a package was removed
from an overlay or if a whole overlay is not in the database anymore.

The special value B<repository> is a reasonable compromise:
If repository data was stored during emerge (this is the case only with current
portage versions; you can use B<eix-test-obsolete [no-]repository> to check
for which versions this is (not) the case) then this repository data is always used.
Only if it is unreadable or does not match, the behaviour for that version
is the same as in case B<CHECK_INSTALLED_OVERLAYS=false>.

Especially in connection with option -T (if B<NONEXISTENT_IF_OTHER_OVERLAY>
is true) and with option -J the speed increase is enormously if you set this
variable to B<false> or B<repository>, but you should be aware that the
information used about the installed overlay is not completely reliable
(for versions installed with old portage versions).
In particular, the option -T will not detect if an installed version of
a package actually stems from a redundant overlay if in the current database
all versions of this package stem from one (other) location.
.TP
.BR OBSOLETE_MINUSASTERISK " " (true / false)
If true, treat B<-*> in /etc/portage/package.keywords as portage-2.1.2 and earlier versions do.
Since portage-2.1.2, the B<-*> keyword is practically obsolete and was replaced by B<**> which accepts anything (even an ebuild with empty B<KEYWORDS>).
Note that there are also the related keywords B<*> and B<~*> which accept stable or unstable versions of any arch listed in B<KEYWORDS>.
.TP
.BR PRINT_COUNT_ALWAYS " " (true / false / never)
If true, always print the number of matches in the last line, even if this
number is 0 or 1.
If B<PRINT_COUNT_ALWAYS=never>, then this last line is omitted completely.
Both is normally not useful but might simplify writing certain scripts
parsing the output of eix.
.TP
.BR COUNT_ONLY_PRINTED " " (true / false)
If false, print only the number of matches, independently of whether the
matches actually lead to some output.
This might be useful for certain scripts if you are only interested in the
number of matches and use e.g. B<FORMAT=''> to speed things up.
.TP
.\" {{{ Default match fields and algorithms
.BR DEFAULT_MATCH_FIELD " " "(string list)"
This is a list of strings of the form I<regular_expression>[\\n\\r\\t ]I<match_field>
which is used to determine the default match field.
The search pattern from the command line is matched against all the I<regular_expression>
values in this list in the given order.
For the first match, the corresponding I<match_field> value is used as the default match field.
You can specify a last I<match_field> (without a I<regular_expression>) in this list which is
used as the default fallback if all matches failed; if there is no such entry, then B<name> is assumed.
It may be convenient to use delayed substitution ${\\VAR} for I<regular_expression>
to avoid manually inserting additional escapes.

The possible values for I<match_field> are B<name>, B<category>, B<category/name>
(or B<category-name>), B<description>, B<license>, B<homepage>, B<provide>, B<virtual>, B<set>,
B<slot>, B<installed-slot>, B<use> (or B<iuse>), B<with-use> (or B<installed-with-use>),
B<without-use> (or B<installed-without-use>),
corresponding to the analogous command line option for the match field.
The special value B<virtual> selects simultaneously the two command line options B<-A> and B<-P>.
.TP
.BR DEFAULT_MATCH_ALGORITHM " " "(string list)"
This is a list of strings of the form I<regular_expression>[\\n\\r\\t ]I<match_algorithm>
which is used to determine the default match algorithm.

B<string> describes which versions should be tested.
It can have the following values:
.TP
.SS
.BR no " or " false
Do not test for this type of redundancy.
.TP
.SS
.B some
It suffices that the redundancy occurs for some version in the database.
.TP
.SS

The redundancy must occur for all versions in the database.
.TP
.SS

It suffices that the redundancy occurs for some installed version.
Uninstalled versions are ignored for this test.
.TP
.SS
.B all-installed
The redundancy must occurs at least for all installed versions of the package.
If no version is installed, it must occur at least once.
.TP

It suffices that the redundancy occurs for some uninstalled version.
Installed versions are ignored for this test.

The redundancy must occurs at least for all uninstalled versions.
If all versions in the database are installed, it must occur at least once.
.TP
.SS
.BR "-" "some of the above  or  " "+" "some of the above"
The test only applies if in addition no version (in case B<->)
resp. at least some version (in case B<+>) of the package is installed.
.TP
.SS
.RB "some of the above  " or "  some of the above"
The result is positive if at least one of the two tests is positive.
Instead of "B<or>"  also the symbols "B<|>" or "B<||>" can be used.
.TP
.BR REDUNDANT_IF_DOUBLE_LINE " " (string)
Applies if /etc/portage/package.keywords has two lines for identical targets,
i.e. such that portage would drop the first of these lines.
Note that lines with targets B<foo/bar> and B<=foo/bar-1> are considered as
different in this context by portage (and thus also by eix)
even if B<foo/bar> would apply to version B<1>.
The latter redundancy can be found implicitly with B<REDUNDANT_IF_DOUBLE_LINE>,
B<REDUNDANT_IF_MIXED>, and B<REDUNDANT_IF_STRANGE>.
.TP
.BR REDUNDANT_IF_MIXED " " (string ", see above")
Applies if /etc/portage/package.keywords lists two different keywords,
e.g. ~ARCH and -*, for the versions in question.
.TP
.BR REDUNDANT_IF_WEAKER " " (string ", see above")
Applies if /etc/portage/package.keywords lists a keywords which can
be replaced by a weaker keyword, e.g. -* or ~OTHERARCH or OTHERARCH
in place of ~ARCH, or ~OTHERARCH in place of OTHERARCH,
for the versions in question.
.TP
.BR REDUNDANT_IF_STRANGE " " (string ", see above")
Applies if /etc/portage/package.keywords lists a strange keyword,
e.g. UNKNOWNARCH (unknown to the .ebuild and ARCH) or -OTHERARCH,

Applies if /etc/portage/package.keywords provides keywords which do not
change the availability keywords status for the versions in question.

Applies if /etc/portage/package.use matches twice
for the versions in question.
.TP
.BR REDUNDANT_IF_DOUBLE_CFLAGS " " (string ", see above")
Applies if /etc/portage/package.cflags matches twice
for the versions in question.
Note that this file is not supported by portage, but you might e.g. have built some
support for it in your personal /etc/portage/bashrc file.
Of course, this means that also no format for /etc/portage/package.cflags is defined.
eix assumes that the format is analogous to /etc/portage/package.{keywords,use}
(i.e. an entry is at most one line, with the matching version(s) at the beginning).
As the other /etc/portage/package.* files, /etc/portage/package.cflags may also be a directory tree;
in this case, all non-hidden files/subdirectories in this tree are read recursively,
resolving all symbolic links.
.TP
.BR REDUNDANT_IF_IN_KEYWORDS " " (string ", see above")
Applies if /etc/portage/package.keywords contains a nonempty entry matching the versions in question
(to find empty entries use -t).
Of course, one will certainly not consider all matches as a redundancy
(although one might misuse this option to simply list all matches).
However, one might consider matching but non-installed packages as redundant.
Hence, typically one might want to set this variable to the value B<-some> or the equivalent value B<-some-uninstalled>
(or to B<false> if one thinks that entries for uninstalled packages are "normal" and not redundant).

.\" {{{ versionsort
.SH versionsort
B<versionsort> is a helper tool for scripts which serves two purposes.
It cuts the version strings from its arguments or interprets the arguments
themselves as version strings (depending on some heuristics).
Then it outputs the version strings in a sorted order, according to the
portage rules of version sorting.
If there is more than one argument, each version (including the last one)
is followed by a newline.
For example,

.B versionsort gcc-4.4 4.4_alpha0 sys-devel/gcc-4.05 4.5

will output

.B 4.05

.B 4.4_alpha0

.B 4.4

.B 4.5

If you pass only one argument, eix is more sloppy about the version rules;
even if the version part is not completely correct, it is guaranteed
in this case that the output is string-equal to the version part.
Thus, you can use versionsort with one argument to split the package name
from the version part in a shell script by

B<split=1-font-adobe-75dpi-1.3-r1>

B<version=`versionsort "X${split}"`; name=${split%"-${version}"}>

Although currently it makes no difference, it is safer in such a case
(concerning possible future extensions of the version format)
to let the argument(s) start with a non-number (like B<X> in the above example)
to make sure that versionsort will really cut the version from the argument
and cannot misinterpret the whole argument as a version.

.\" {{{ BUGS
.SH "BUGS (and sort of FAQ)"
.LP
For bugreports use either I<@PACKAGE_BUGREPORT@> or Gentoo's bugzilla I<http://bugs.gentoo.org/>

eix does not and probably never will support dependencies and/or useflags.
In particular, this means that eix -u output will be in general different
from the output of an emerge update command - rely only the latter for your system.
This holds in particular also for the upgrades of packages with slots.
The variable B<UPGRADE_TO_HIGHEST_SLOT> and manual exceptions
in B</etc/portage/package.slot_upgrade_forbid> or
B</etc/portage/package.slot_upgrade_allow>, respectively, can be used to
manually work around some of these shortcomings somewhat.

eix does not and never will fully support all sets which portage does support.
Currently, it appears that even the proposed way of PROPERTIES=set to put
packages in the tree will never be supported by eix (because eix would need
full support for dependencies and useflags to handle these).
As a workaround you can manually define such additional sets in
B</etc/portage/sets.eix>.
Moreover, eix does not and probably never will support reading of sets.conf files.
If you specified additional B<sets/> directories e.g. in some overlay, you must
add these additional directories manually to the B<EIX_LOCAL_SETS> variable
in @SYSCONFDIR@/eixrc.
The easiest way to do the latter is to put an entry like

B<EIX_LOCAL_SETS_ADD=">I</path/to/overlay1/sets> I</path/to/overlay2/sets> I<...>B<">

into @SYSCONFDIR@/eixrc (see the description of B<EIX_LOCAL_SETS> above).

eix-diff does never consider /etc/portage/profile. (Reason: The saved database
contains only the masking state according to the original profile, but not the
profile itself.
On the other hand, /etc/portage/profile can only be interpreted when the
profile is known.)

The output with the default B<OVERLAYS_LIST=all-used-renumbered> is confusing when one wants
to use the overlay number in some eix variable/command-argument.

There is no cache method setting which gets information from overlays
(for which no portage cache metadata is available) fast and reliable -
you must always choose between one of these two extremes.
The default is the fast one, but it shows often false slots and has other problems.

All the B<EPREFIX>/B<ROOT> stuff is confusing.
In particular, by the mere fact of allowing much of these variables,
eix will always be vulnerable to local attacks if it is called with a possibly unsafe environment.

The previous default B<KEEP_VIRTUALS=true> used to confuse people.
However, with the new default, nobody will find out that this feature exists.
:(

There is no default setting of B<OBSOLETE_MINUSASTERISK> which satisfies both,
people using old portage and people using new portage.

There are too many features: The documentation and configuration has become too complicated.
On the other hand, there are still many things which cannot be configured...
.\" }}}

.\" {{{ HISTORY
.SH "HISTORY"
.LP
B<eix> was formerly known as B<portagedb>. The name was changed because a part of
portage is also called portagedb, which was a bit confusing for everyone.

The functionality of eix-update was once triggered by using the -u switch on eix.
It was than separated to provide better maintainability.
Thus B<update-eix> came to life.
Meanwhile, it is the same executable with functionality distinguished by its call name.
and the original name update-eix was renamed into B<eix-update>.

Also B<eix-diff> was previously called B<diff-eix>,
B<eix-remote> was previously called B<update-eix-remote>,
B<eix-layman> was previously called B<update-eix-layman>, and
B<eix-functions.sh> was previously called B<functions-eix.sh> (and much earlier B<update-eix-functions.sh>).
The reason for all these renamings is to have a more consistent naming scheme:
All programs belonging to eix now start with eix-* (with the exception of
B<versionsort> which is more or less just an independent tool).
If you cannot get accustomed to this new naming scheme or have scripts depending
on the old names, you can use symbolic links for the original names;
this is explicitly supported and is not intended to be deprecated.
Moreover, if you call eix' B<./configure> with B<--enable-obsolete-symlinks> or
B<--enable-obsolete-reminder> then such symlinks (or wrappers which also
print a reminder about the obsolete names, respectively) are installed automatically.
However, such symlinks are not installed by default, because new users will not need them.
So it is advisable to update your scripts to the new names if they should ever run on newer systems.
Moreover, also in B<eix-functions.sh> two functions have been renamed for consistency reasons
(B<CallUpdateEix> -> B<CallUpdate> and B<ClearUpdateEixArgs> -> B<ClearUpdateArgs>),
and also the internal variable they use has been renamed (but the latter was never intended to be used by scripts).
If you use one of the above mentioned B<./configure> options, then also a wrapper for
B<functions-eix.sh> will be installed which supports the obsolete function names
(and prints a warning when they are used in case of B<--enable-obsolete-reminder>).

Since the introduction of the %{*VARIABLE} syntax in eix-0.8.0, it is not
reasonable anymore to use different variable names for eix and eix-diff.
Hence, all corresponding B<DIFF_*> variables have vanished.

The cache method B<metadata-flat> was previously just called B<metadata>.
The cache method B<assign> was previously called B<backport> or B<portage-2.1>.
The cache method B<flat> had previously the name B<portage-2.0> which was even preferred.
Anyway, the obsolete names are still supported.

portage-2.1 and portage-2.1.1 doesn't remove the old dep-cache, thus eix might
find packages that are not in portage anymore if the B<flat>/B<assign>
cache method is used.
To circumvent this, eix-sync used to delete the old cache
(rm -rf /var/cache/edb/dep/*).
Since most people have no need to use this cache method anymore and
deleting the old cache slows down the next portage run, this is
not the default anymore (but still available as an option which can be
put into @SYSCONFDIR@/eix-sync.conf).

eix-sync used to default to gensync instead of layman.
See the description of @SYSCONFDIR@/eix-sync.conf how you can still use the
deprecated gensync if you want to.

eix-sync no longer supports logging; options -v and -V have been removed.
This avoids problems like no visible output with EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS=--ask.
You should now use redirection when you want to use eix-sync in a cronjob.

The mechanism described now by B<DEFAULT_MATCH_FIELD> has changed.
The previous (less powerful) B<MATCH_.*_IF> and B<MATCH_ORDER> variables
are not supported anymore.

The B<ADD_CACHE_METHOD> and B<ADD_OVERRIDE_CACHE_METHOD> variables are no longer
built-ins but only used implicitly in delayed substitution in the default of
B<CACHE_METHOD> and B<OVERRIDE_CACHE_METHOD>.
In particular, setting the latter variables in B<@SYSCONFDIR@/eixrc> without adding
the delayed substitution " B<%{ADD_CACHE_METHOD}>" or " B<%{ADD_OVERRIDE_CACHE_METHOD}>",
respectively, will prevent the former variables to have any meaning.

Before eix-0.18.0, customizable version output properties like
.BI "<installedversions:" "VAR" ">"
or
.BI "<availableversions:" "VAR" ">"
did not exist.
Instead there was a chaos of parameters for
.B "<installedversions:*>"
and a bulk of variants for printing available or installed versions for
feeding the output to scripts like
.BR "<fullvailableversions>"
etc.
Now all this has vanished: The variables B<NAMEVERSIONS>, B<EQNAMEVERSION>,
B<ANAMESLOT>, B<ANAMEASLOT>, B<NAMESLOT>, B<NAMEASLOT>, and B<DATESORT>
take the role of all the earlier variants (where B<DATESORT> demonstrates
a related example that was previously not available).
See the description of these variables in B<eix --dump> for details.
To see the effect of such an example try e.g.

.B eix --format '<availableversions:ANAMESLOT:ANAMESLOT>' --pure-packages gcc

See also the comments for the B<-I> option.

Since eix-0.20.0 the logical connectives for EXPRESSIONs have changed dramatically:
Not only braces are now possible, also chains with B<-a> and B<-o> are now treated
left-associative as most users would intuitively expect.
The negation B<--not> is now treated as a logical operation starting a new BRACE_OR_TEST
and no longer considered as part of TEST_OPTIONS (which was a source of confusion for many users).
Now B<--pipe> is really handled as part of TEST_OPTIONS and does not implicitly introduce logical connectives.
