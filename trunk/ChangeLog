# ChangeLog for eix - Ebuild IndeX for portage

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Added metadata as cache-method.
	- Added a workaround for http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=114628
	  Looks like the problems isn't eix, but some part of the toolchain.

*eix-0.5.1

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Fixed trim/rtrim/ltrim: strings that only contain trim-characters are
	  cleared now. This fixes all the 'Unable to split mask "" ..' bugs.
	- portage-2.1 introduced big changes to the depcache-handling, the old
	  cache is no longer removed. Old entries are not removed. But update-eix
	  needs the cache to be ok, thus eix-sync removes the old depcache in
	  /var/cache/edb/dep.
	- More verbose output if problems with files in /etc/portage/ or the
	  profile pop up.
	  This should stop reports like http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116592
	- Fixed http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=117407 and removed a
	  compilation-error for -pedantic -ansi -W -Wall -Werror
	- Moved the code in ExplodeAtom from regex to short, _fast_ and hand-written
	  parser-code.
	- Added a compare(..) method to basicversion. This compare-method is used
	  in all other comparators, thus decreasing LOC and a bit more efficient.
	- Rewrote big parts of Mask; Be more verbose about parse-errors; Correctly
	  parse wildcard-stuff; Remove regular-expression stuff;
	- Default cache for PORTDIR_CACHE_METHOD can be chosen by
	  configure-parameter.

*eix-0.5

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Fixed a small bug regarding -o/-a and atoms with a pattern .. thanks to
	  leonie for bringing this to my attention.
	- Added PROVIDE; bumped db-version
	- Fixing http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=111927
	- Added our own strndup-implementation that will be used for ppc-macos
	  See http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=111912
	- Finally, environment variables can be used to override eixrc-stuff.
	- Applied patch from http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=111865, thanks JeR
	- Applied patch from http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=112776
	- Applied patch from http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=112806
	- Applied patches for scandir, sed, byteorder and regex from
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=111912
	- Fixed some small memory-leaks - valgrind reports one more that leads
	  into the glibc (getpwnam) .. but this is really a leak. See
	  --run-glibc-freeres in valgrind(1).
	- Rewrite BasicVersion (much more efficient) and fixes
	  http://dev.croup.de/proj/eix/ticket/1
	- Fix http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=113735

*eix-0.5_beta

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Formatstring(Conditions): If a "else" was missing, the if-true part was
	  linked to if-false.
	- Changed the arch-part of the dbheader from char[16] to string.
	- Fixed http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=104083 - once again:
	  unsigned int vs. vector::size_type
	- Moved from #define in basicio.h to a namespace io with generic
	  read/write-functions for POD and {read,write}_string for strings.
	  Slowly moving other read/write-code into that namespace.
	- Bumped to 0.3.1
	- eix-sync hides output of emerge --sync and update-eix per default. Added
	  cli-options -v, -h, -q
	- Fixed a non-existing bug :) http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97462
	- Fixed a rather *extrem* bug: The read-only-what-we-need-to-check-if-the-package-matches
	  wasn't used at all! This brings an extrem speedup.
	- Fixed http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=105935
	- I just love auto_ptr!

*eix-0.3.0

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Moved explodeShit(..) into a class with static members. Changed
	  RegExClass to Regex and changed some internals. Category was merged into
	  PackageDatabase. Removed 'this->' and ; after methods.
	- After having a nice talk with Kyuu, I added
	  LOCAL_PORTAGE_CONFIG=true/false to eixrc. It's possible to tell eix to
	  ignore all local configuration like /etc/portage and ACCEPT_KEYWORDS.
	  Yes, I know that this could be done by a alias in $SHELL.
	- Fixed (think) http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=103836. offset_type wasn't
	  off_t everywhere.

*eix-0.3.0_beta
*eix-0.2.7

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- PortageInstalledPackages now catches a exception thrown by BasicVersion
	  and prints the message rather then dying. For example, lockfiles in
	  /var/db/pkg are no longer lethal for eix.
	- Did the same to Mask parsing (don't die, but print an error)
	- Added target and gcc-version to the output of both, eix -V and
	  update-eix -V.
	- Fixed a bug in the cdb-code: munmap was called for bad pointers.
	- Fixed http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97914 (Thanks to
	  David Held <andukar@andukar.org> for the patch.
	- Fixed compilation-problems http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98218.
	  Patch by Cyrille Mescam <titi@oboulo.com>.
	- Masks like '>app-portage/eix-0.2*' are finally accepted by update-eix.
	- Finally changed our formatstring-code! We are no longer parsing the
	  string every time we need to print something. It's now parsed into a
	  list of structs which is much faster processed.
	- Fixed compile-errors about undefined flags from varsreader once and for all!
	- Started working on diff-eix (part of our 'esync' functionality)
	- More progress with diff-eix - currently WIP (work in progress)
	- Added IF-ELSE-FI constructs to the formatstrings (this could be the
	  final state of my featuritis ..)
	- Rewrote our stability-calculation-thingy, KEYWORDS="-* ~ARCH" is now
	  reported as TESTING (yellow color)
	- Read /etc/portage/package.{unmask,mask} on-the-fly
	- Honour ACCEPT_KEYWORDS correctly and started working on code for
	  package.keywords
	- Finished package.keywords code and basic diff-eix stuff.
	- Added sbin-script eix-sync. It's our esync!

*eix-0.2.6

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Fixed an old bug in our parameter-parsing. The first flag after an
	  implicit OR was ignored.

*eix-0.2.5

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Fixed http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=88148
	- Committed reviewed manpage (Thanks Legoguy)
	- Overlay reading: Check result of explodePkgFilename before using it
	- Added --version/-V options
	- Added patch from http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=89376
	  by Mike Gardiner <obz@gentoo.org>
	- Rewrote big parts of update-eix. We now have different classes for
	  different portage cache-backends.
	- Added a more descriptive section about ~/.eirx to the manpage.

*eix-0.2.2 (2005/03/26)

	Wolfgang Frisch <xororand at users.sourceforge.net>:
	- Applied patch: gentoo releases == 0 now are accepted & changed metadata
	  cache directory to /var/cache/edb/dep/$PORTDIR

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Made the fsm recognize references to variables in declarations .. i.e.
	  USE="${USE} -kde".  This is important for proper make.conf/make.defaults
	  parsing.
	- Created CascadingProfile as a subclass of PortageSettings
	- Added maskings from profile
	- Added system-profile-stuff (somewhat depends on virtual/ packages ..)
	- Removed split of category into rootcat-subcat
	- And some other pretty radical changes
	- Rewrote args.cc (OOP'ish :) and added bash-completion
	- User root no longer needed to update database
	- Moved some functionality into separate toolkits.
	- Added ~-operator to class Mask

*eix-0.2.1 (2005/02/24)

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Removed deprecated Constructor from ExBasic and changed all calls
	- Removed big ugly patternmachting from portagedb.cc and moved to
	  criteria.cc (now even more ugly :) -- added wildcards.cc for wildcards-matching.
	- Moved DBQuery from portagedb.cc to filedb.cc
	- Moved PortageInstalledPackages to portageconf.cc and made it pseudo-caching
	- Removed getopt-stuff from main.cc -- this is now recursively done in
	  criteria.cc (with help from args.cc )
	- Various other small cleanups/fixes ..
	- Added --dump, --quiet and --dup-versions; Use xororand formatstring.cc
	  for output of results

	Wolfgang Frisch <xororand at users.sourceforge.net>:
	- Added a wiki: http://eixwiki.unfoog.de
	- Added parameter -l,--lineversions for printing versions line-by-line
	  like "etcat -v"
	- Added format strings to allow customized output. See manpage and
	  http://eixwiki.unfoog.de/index.php/Usage#Format_strings
	- Yet another 'version number sorting'-fix. Now: 1.2a < 1.2b
	- Moved Portage settings parts from PortageDB to new class PortageSettings

*eix-0.2.0

	Beholders_Eye (Gentoo Forums)
	- Fixed two warnings

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Fixed various bugs

	Wolfgang Frisch <xororand at users.sourceforge.net>:
	- 'eix -u' crashed when it met files like abc.ebuild.xyz in overlay
	  package directories. This has been fixed.

*eix-0.2.0_beta (2005/02/12)

	Wolfgang Frisch <xororand at users.sourceforge.net>:
	- Fixed a reported bug in version.cc: Some package versions were omitted
	  in eix-0.2.0_alpha and probably in earlier versions too. Example: A
	  package with 2.1 and 2.1.1 only showed 2.1.
	- Fixed a small issue with handling files like "abc.ebuild.xyz" in portage
	  overlay directories

	Kay Ramon "YakS" Sauter <yaks-gentoo at users.sourceforge.net>:
	- Added man page

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Included minor fixes from Christian Heim <christian.th.heim at gmx.de>
	- Big cleanups in readoverlay to fix 2 major bugs
	  http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=80241 and
	  http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?p=2005152#2005152
	- Added -I to search only installed packages. If no search pattern is
	  given it prints all installed packages.
	- Changed version.cc, added a test for version.cc, added 'keys' for
	  packages/versions from overlays and moved cleaned some classes(moved
	  attributes to private/protected).

*eix-0.2.0_alpha (2005/02/01)

	xororand <xororand at users.sourceforge.net>:
	- Fixed a "versions reported twice"-bug
	- Added --fuzzy search option to allow unsharp search queries (no regular
	  expressions).
	- Closed memory leaks
	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Constructed a FSM (finite state machine) to replace the regex-massacre
	  in varsreader.cc.
	- Fixed the "-S does not search the name, just the description"-bug and
	  added warnings if keyUndefined occurs while updating the db
	- Rewrote package::getStability(..) so it can distinguish between ppc and
	  ppc64, x86 and x86-obsd .. and so on
	- Converted the db-read/write code to use c-style FILE*, fread, fwrite. This fixes
	  the ppc-problem described in http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic.php?p=2036103#2036103
	  Thanks meyerm for testing :)
	xororand <xororand at users.sourceforge.net>:
	- Fixed: packages with ebuilds in multiple overlays are no longer reported twice
	- Increased loading speed of the database
	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Various updates to autoconf-stuff including --with-cachefile=FILE for configure
	  and update of VERSION in configure.in
	- Show "file:line" when throwing a exception
	- Rewrote get_arch()

*eix-0.1.4 (2005/01/22)

	xororand <xororand at users.sourceforge.net>:
	- Added: multi-line entries in ebuild and/or /etc/make.conf are parsed
	  variables declared without double quotation marks are recognized correctly
	  as well as tab characters in PORTDIR_OVERLAY
	- Versions which are not tested on your architecture (arch not in KEYWORDS)
	  are now shown by default (previously: only with -v)
	  I changed the prefix for such versions from [M~] to [-]

	Emil Beinroth <emilbeinroth at gmx.net>:
	- Cleaned the command line parser to use the quasi-standard getopts() which
	  is used by almost any Unix program.
	  eix -s is now default, so you can simply type "eix REGEXP" to search for packages.

	xororand <xororand at users.sourceforge.net>:
	- added support for /etc/portage/categories

*eix-0.1.3 (2005/01/17)

	xororand <xororand at users.sourceforge.net>:
	- Fixed bug: multiple spaces in PORTDIR_OVERLAY (/etc/make.conf) were
	  interpreted as / overlays
	- Fixed: Version numbers should finally be sorted properly.
	  Explanation: In 0.1.2 versions were only splitted in [primary, e.g. |
	  1.2.3][suffix | _alpha5][gentoo-release | -r2]
	  Now, the primary string is also splitted into integers => 2.6.2 < 2.6.10
	- Added more detail to the error messages in version.cc (in hopes to
	  resolve kay's problem)

*eix-0.1.2 (2005/01/13)

	xororand <xororand at users.sourceforge.net>:
	- Bekks removed the unnecessary libstdc++v3 dependency from the ebuild
	- The currently installed version of each package is now displayed again
	  Note: Slotted versions are still not supported
	- Corrected a bug of 0.1.0: All versions are displayed again
	- The -v parameter now also shows "arch masked" package versions, e.g. [M~]1.2.3-r4
	- Reverted to the old get_arch code because of an error on an amd64 system
	- Fixed a small bug in command-line parsing

*eix-0.1.0 (2005/01/09)

	xororand <xororand at users.sourceforge.net>:
	- Renamed portagedb to eix
